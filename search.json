            "content"    : "Gentle touch shown to reduce pain.Newborns suffer from airway suctioning, but careful positioning is likely to help.The Facts:Cochrane presented (https://www.cochrane.org/CD013353/NEONATAL_medicine-free-management-neonates-pain-during-endotracheal-suctioning) a study of a painful medical procedure in neonates. Many newborns, particularly preterm, cannot breathe very well, so a common procedure, so-called endotracheal suctioning, involves clearing their airways by sucking excessive secretions into a catheter. And, it’s known to be painful, so the recent study (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013353.pub2) looked at what can be done to alleviate suffering, apart from the obvious medications – painkillers and anesthetics.After analyzing data from 148 neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) patients across four randomized trials, the researchers were moderately certain that so-called facilitated tucking reduces suction-associated pain in neonates on mechanical ventilation. Facilitated tucking is a positioning technique that involves gently bending a baby’s arms and legs, as shown in the image above. A 13–20% change (https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/9.suppl_a.44aa) on the pain scale used in these trials is likely to be noticed by health care workers and caregivers alike, and facilitated tucking produced a 14–40% change. There are several instruments (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40138-016-0089-y) for pain assessment in infants, and the one used here, Premature Infant Pain Profile, derives its scoring points from observing the baby’s facial actions, heart rate, and oxygen saturation.When planning their study, the authors wanted to assess all kinds of non-pharmaceutical treatments, including rocking the baby, skin-to-skin contact, or breastfeeding. It turned out that only gentle touch techniques were appropriately studied in the suctioning context. The researchers also wanted to assess a variety of outcomes, including mortality, nausea, vomiting, or intracranial hemorrhage but ended up looking at just the pain scores because these other outcomes were not reported.The uneasy side of medicine is that treating hurts sometimes. When it comes to children, pain is a particularly sensitive issue. The uncomfortable truth (https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.157.11.1058) is that newborn babies experience pain from medical procedures, too. Even worse – that pain is theorized (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0744-6) to have an immense impact on brain development, potentially leading to devastating consequences. The new evidence concerning facilitated tucking and windpipe suctioning shows us just how much a gentle human touch can matter.The Evidence:  A Cochrane study (https://www.cochrane.org/CD013353/NEONATAL_medicine-free-management-neonates-pain-during-endotracheal-suctioning) analyzed data from 148 neonatal ICU patients across 4 randomized trials to see if facilitated tucking (gently bending a baby’s arms and legs) reduces pain in neonates on mechanical ventilation undergoing endotracheal suctioning.  The scientists found (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.cd013353.pub2) moderate-certainty evidence that facilitated tucking reduces pain by 2.0 to 3.6 points on the Premature Infant Pain Profile (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40138-016-0089-y) scale used. Based on previous studies (https://doi.org/10.1093/pch/9.suppl_a.44aa), a drop of about 1.5 points is likely to be noticeable to some parents, and of 2.3 points to clinicians.  The researchers wanted to assess other non-pharmaceutical treatments like rocking, skin-to-skin contact, or breastfeeding, but only gentle touch techniques were well-studied for this procedure.  They also wanted to look at outcomes like mortality, nausea/vomiting, and hemorrhage, but data unavailability forced the researchers to limit analyses to just pain scores.  This new evidence comes as hopeful news against the uncomfortable truth that medical procedures cause newborns pain (https://doi.org/10.1001/archpedi.157.11.1058), with early-life pain theorized (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41390-019-0744-6) to impact brain development.The Research:Notes  If you want to contract Zheln’s services or simply reach out, do send us an email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com).

            "content"    : "Seatbelt promotion works. But how well?60% of drivers still don’t use seat belts (and even more passengers).Note: As of January 2024, the map is no longer accurate because, for example, in Mexico, a law was enacted in 2022 that made seat belts obligatory for all passengers (https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/ley-de-movilidad-todos-los-pasajeros-deben-usar-el-cinturon-de-seguridad-en-todo-el-pais/).The Facts:The idea of the usefulness of seat belts for the prevention of deaths and serious injuries in car accidents seems to be indisputable among public health officials. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advocate (https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/seatbelts/facts.html) the use of seat belts, claiming that they “reduce serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about half” and reportedly “saved almost 15,000 lives in 2017,” based on U.S. data. Global status report on road safety 2023 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240086517) by the reputable World Health Organization (WHO) warns, “Failure to use seat-belts is a major risk factor for road traffic deaths and injuries among vehicle occupants,” and commends seat-belt mandates, shown in the image above.If we look up some of the evidence cited, seat belts were tentatively found (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-6280-1) to reduce the risk of overall injuries, but a subgroup analysis by the location of the critical injury gave inconclusive results, meaning that some types of injuries may actually be unprevented by seat belts, such as head, neck, or chest trauma. This does not necessarily mean seat belts don’t work. In fact, seat belts are associated with an abdominal injury of their own (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajem.2023.11.058), even though the risk of overall abdominal injuries decreases, as the aforementioned subgroup analysis suggests. The physics of seat belts in simulated car crashes  make it visual (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_Af8w2SAT4) how they work: by restraining the user, they won’t let them move forward after the car has crashed against a barrier, which hopefully saves lives. A 2011 analysis (https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-7922-6-18) based on WHO’s data from 46 high-income countries showed that seat-belt compliance was strongly associated with road traffic death rates. There is room for speculation about causality here, however, as these are high-level data that do not preclude the existence of a third variable that improves both seat-belt compliance and motor vehicle accident statistics, thus remaining masked in the analysis.A recent study (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011218.pub2) by Cochrane, the world’s leader in synthesizing medical evidence, went unnoticed in the news media (see our research (#the-research)). This analysis looked at the effectiveness of activities promoting the use of seat belts. The activities studied included various education formats offered in sites such as workplaces, schools, or health care organizations, and a couple of trials investigated in-vehicle data monitoring and alert systems, with the majority of data collection conducted in the US. Cochrane has already published a useful summary (https://www.cochrane.org/CD011218/INJ_interventions-encourage-use-seat-belts) of this study for the general public, which concluded that they “found some evidence to suggest education-based (behavioural and health risk appraisal (HRA)) and engineering-based interventions may promote seat-belt use in early and late adolescents and adults; however, we are not confident in the current evidence.” Zheln has reviewed (#the-research) their entire scientific report and confirms that this statement is accurate. To elaborate a bit on what exactly Cochrane did in this study, they looked at 15 randomized trials encompassing over 12,000 participants but were unable to combine these data due to their very mixed nature, so they ended up looking at each trial separately. It’s also of note that all 15 trials had a high risk of inflated findings, but that was more of a limitation of the study setting than a failure on the researchers’ part. Importantly, none of the trials reported on crash-related injuries or deaths.The best takeaway from this complex picture is probably that our understanding of how the seat belt, or rather, seat-belt promotion works in practice is still quite vague. A previous study found modest but positive (https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2021.1921168) evidence of the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in increasing the use of seat belts. A US-based analysis found (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-4575(03)00038-1) a median increase of 33 percentage points in observed seat-belt use after the enactment of seat-belt enforcement laws. With all these measures in place, seat-belt use is still far from universal: its pooled global rate, as of 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-023-00139-3), was at about 40% for drivers, 35% for front-seat passengers, and 10–15% for rear-seat passengers. We can also clearly see how the evidence in which the effectiveness claims are grounded is predominantly US-based.The Evidence:  Public health organizations like the CDC (https://www.cdc.gov/transportationsafety/seatbelts/facts.html) and WHO (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240086517) advocate for seat-belt use, claiming they reduce crash-related injuries and deaths by about half and save thousands of lives yearly.  Evidence on seat-belt effectiveness is inconclusive (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-018-6280-1) for some types of injuries – they may prevent overall injuries but not certain ones like head, neck, or chest trauma.  Car crash simulations show (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_Af8w2SAT4) how seat belts restrain occupants and prevent them from moving forward during an accident.  Analysis of WHO data associates (https://doi.org/10.1186/1749-7922-6-18) seat-belt compliance with lower road death rates across 46 high-income countries, but causality is speculative.  A recent Cochrane review (https://www.cochrane.org/CD011218/INJ_interventions-encourage-use-seat-belts) found some evidence that education and in-vehicle alerts may promote seat-belt use in adolescents and adults, but the evidence is not very certain.  That Cochrane review (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD011218.pub2) looked at over 12,000 across 15 randomized trials but couldn’t combine the data due to heterogeneity. None of the trials measured crash-related outcomes.  Other analyses found positive impacts of media campaigns (https://doi.org/10.1080/15389588.2021.1921168) and laws (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0001-4575(03)00038-1) on seat-belt use.  Despite promotion efforts, seat-belt use rates remain low globally (https://doi.org/10.1186/s42506-023-00139-3) – around 40% for drivers, 35% for front passengers, and 10–15% for rear passengers.  Most evidence on seat-belt effectiveness comes from the U.S. context.  In summary, our understanding of the real-world effectiveness of seat-belt promotion is still quite vague.The Research:Notes  If you want to contract Zheln’s services or simply reach out, do send us an email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com).

            "content"    : "Tamiflu not shown to prevent severe flu.Consumer advice is not clear on this, so we reiterate.The Facts:Tamiflu, an anti-flu medication, reduces the duration of illness by about half a day on average and prevents 2­–4% of cases of symptomatic flu, but it does not prevent positive lab tests if the person has no symptoms, and it also increases the rate of nausea, vomiting, and headache. This is the evidence from a major 2014 study (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4), whose results are mirrored pretty accurately in two of Google’s top hits for Tamiflu (https://www.google.com/search?q=tamiflu), consumer webpages by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tamiflu-consumer-questions-and-answers) (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu) (EMA).Tamiflu has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations. The agencies are not trying to make it look like it did, but they are not particularly vocal about this either. True: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; but, when multiple well conducted trials failed to prove the effect, it might be worth highlighting these findings. Otherwise, it is just logical to assume that if the drug is  active against viruses (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LSP02MkNOU), then it should reduce the risk of severe illness. At short notice, Zheln did not find much evidence people actually assume that, but at least one of the top Google results does seem to follow this logic (https://www.parents.com/health/cold-flu/flu/tamiflu-and-kids-everything-parents-need-to-know/); “Early treatment with Tamiflu can lead to milder illness, which lessens the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with the flu,” they write. However, other top Google hits are pretty circumspect in giving account (https://www.drugs.com/tips/tamiflu-patient-tips) of Tamiflu’s effects. One doctor author suggested (https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/is-it-worth-it-to-take-tamiflu/) that “expectations for Tamiflu are often very high and, frankly, overhyped.” A 2022 news story revealed (https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-offer-free-antiviral-flu-drug-in-pharmacies-1.6192420) that health authorities of one of the regions of Canada worked to offer Tamiflu for free, with a high official saying, “It’s quite effective to prevent complications, hospitalizations.” All in all, it looks like it is worth revisiting the disheartening evidence related to Tamiflu, particularly because a newer study was published (https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0699) in 2023, focusing specifically on the rate of hospital treatment on Tamiflu versus placebo.Zheln is not the first to cover that recent study: New England Journal of Medicine Journal Watch (https://www.jwatch.org/na56236/2023/07/06/oseltamivir-doesnt-prevent-hospitalizations-outpatients), InfectiousDisease Advisor (https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/respiratory/influenza/does-oseltamivir-prevent-all-cause-hospitalization-in-outpatients-with-influenza/), and MedicalXpress (https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-06-oseltamivir-linked-flu-hospitalization.html) highlighted the findings of the study, and MedPage Today (https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/uritheflu/104963) also did a great job interviewing one of the study authors. If you read all of these publications, there is not much Zheln can add, honestly.The most important takeaway would be that when 3,000 mostly White outpatients in their 40s, with flu but relatively healthy otherwise, were treated with Tamiflu across 15 randomized trials, about the same 25 people eventually required hospital treatment as in the similar 3,000 patient group that took placebo and/or standard therapy. Additionally, the rate of nausea or vomiting was at least 13% higher and at most 2.6 times as high on Tamiflu. The quality of the trials was high enough for the researchers to be moderately certain of these findings, making the evidence somewhat less likely to change with future trials being added to the big picture. Zheln’s fifty cents would be that the piece of information enclosed in this paragraph essentially is the evidence – just some numbers with a pinch of scientific scrutiny over it. An important feature of evidence, the reader is free to interpret it the way they see fit. It’s also good to keep in mind that this stuff is as scientific as iPhones, X-rays, or antibiotics, just less visible and tangible (think astronomy).The Evidence:  A 2014 Cochrane systematic review (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4) found that Tamiflu (oseltamivir) reduces flu illness duration by 8–25 hours on average and prevents 2 cases in every 52­–110 cases of symptomatic influenza from happening, but not cases without symptoms. The risk of headache, nausea, and vomiting was higher on treatment. This aligns with info from some of Google’s top hits on Tamiflu (https://www.google.com/search?q=tamiflu), such as those from the FDA (https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tamiflu-consumer-questions-and-answers) and European Medicines Agency (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu).  In the same study, oseltamivir has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations from flu, pooling the data from 7 randomized trials and 4,400 patients, a fact not prominent in the agencies’ statements. However, a brief overview of Google’s top hits revealed that the assumption that Tamiflu prevents serious flu, arising from the general interpretation of its antiviral properties, is not uncommon among the public.  A 2023 systematic review (https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0699) included 15 randomized trials and over 6,100 patients with flu and found no difference in hospitalizations between those given Tamiflu versus those given placebo and/or standard therapy. Additionally, the rate of vomiting was 28% to 163% higher on Tamiflu, and the rate of nausea was 13% to 82% higher. The study participants were mostly White or Asian, in their 40s on average, and with few chronic illnesses.  The quality of the trials was high enough for the researchers to claim moderate certainty of the evidence, making it somewhat less likely to change when future trials are added to the big picture.The Research:Notes  If you want to contract Zheln’s services or simply reach out, do send us an email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com).

            "content"    : "How can doctors know which cancer treatment is better?After reading this post, you will be able to understand this image:The Facts:A major medical study published (https://doi.org/10.3310/GK5221) in December 2023 challenged a common assumption about the best way to treat cancer. Researchers compared multiple treatments of early-stage liver cancer, including surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy, and a newer technique called high-energy destruction or ablation. Using cutting-edge statistical methods, they ranked treatments based on patient survival rates and cancer recurrence levels, accounting for statistical variation and study quality.Surprisingly, the study found that completely removing tumors through surgery – long seen by cancer specialists as the “gold standard” (https://www.cancer.org/cancer/types/liver-cancer/treating/surgery.html) – is no better than less radical options, like ablation, while still leading to more adverse events, including postoperative complications, major complications, and serious pain requiring painkillers.Ablation is the destruction of body tissues using high energies, like heat, microwaves, or laser. It’s often paired with chemotherapy or radiation treatments. The figure above is usually called a “forest plot,” but we’ll use a more practical metaphor: Imagine that each black horizontal line in the image is a track runner, representing a cancer treatment, and the vertical dashed line is the finish line. The blue dot is the runner’s head (the estimated effect from the trials; in this case, overall survival), and the line is the span of the runner’s step (the probability range of the effect estimate, a so-called credibility interval). Our runners are moving from the right to the left, striving to cross the finish line, as in this running track close-up:The positive effect is expressed as a negative number because it means fewer bad events (e.g., deaths), versus “standard therapy” (e.g., radiofrequency ablation). The runner who is the first to cross the finish line completely (with both the head and the feet) becomes the winner. This study attempts to challenge the winning treatment under various statistical conditions, trying to answer the question: Are we sure it is truly better than standard therapy, not incidentally? Maybe the trials generated this spuriously outstanding performance because they were biased, just like a runner suspected of doping.As investigators, we artificially increase and decrease trial results to see how much change the calculations can tolerate before the best-case scenario switches to some other treatment option. Imagine that our runners are riding slugs, represented by light-blue bands, which show the extended probability range that takes trial quality into account (so-called invariant intervals). The slug needs to drag their entire slimey body beyond the finish line before the rider can complete the race. Can you now see which treatment is winning?Spoiler alert: the winner is the 6th slug from the top, representing radiofrequency ablation combined with the implantation of radioactive iodine-125 into the tumor. The head, the feet, and the slug are all across the finish line, so we can be pretty certain of the trial data.Now, look at the 4th band, with the gray bar? That rider has real promise but got ahead of their own slug, which is against the rules, and was disqualified. This 4th line is microwave ablation, and it has a chance of competing with the top-choice procedure, radiofrequency ablation plus radioactive substance, but only if more high-quality trials show its effectiveness.By the way, the traditional hardcore surgery (liver resection) is the 3rd line from the top – can you now tell how well it performed versus radiofrequency ablation? This example shows how the latest scientific methods can challenge clinical assumptions and help pick better options among various possible treatments based on the bulk evidence from human trials.The Evidence:  An over-200-page research report was published (https://doi.org/10.3310/GK5221) in December 2023 that explored evidence on novel treatments of early-stage liver cancer, otherwise known as hepatocellular carcinoma. With respect to this particular cancer, early-stage means the size of the neoplasm less than 3 cm and no distant tumor growth.  Using advanced statistical techniques, developed over the last 25 years (called network meta-analysis), the researchers compared multiple treatments, including high-energy destruction (ablation, laser), irradiation, chemo, surgery (liver resection), ethanol and acid injections, and other dangerous stuff. Additionally, they were able to account for the quality of scientific data by forecasting the impact that it may have on the numbers (using a technique called threshold analysis).  The scientists ranked treatment procedures by their efficacy and calculated the amount of numerical change needed to “overthrow” the top-performing procedure in the “league table.” Two groups of metrics were used to assess efficacy: patient survival (overall and progression-free) and tumor recurrence (overall and local).  The evidence suggested unusual conclusions that contradict clinical judgment or common-sense tumor biology; the most radical treatment, liver surgery, commonly thought to be the most effective treatment due to the full removal of the neoplasm, performed no better than more “dirty” techniques such as radiofrequency ablation. This conclusion stood even when study quality and statistical variation were taken into account.  Additionally, the implantation of radioactive iodine-125 (brachytherapy) boosted the effect of radiofrequency ablation, based on overall survival, and was forecasted to improve overall tumor recurrence rates in future trials. Microwave ablation is a promising competitor of radiofrequency ablation and could outperform it by overall survival and local disease recurrence in future trials.  This evidence illustrates the state-of-the-art scientific techniques employed for picking the best treatment from a range of possible options, as well as selecting the most promising candidates for future studies.The Research:Notes  If you want to contract Zheln’s services or simply reach out, do send us an email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com).

            "content"    : "No evidence cranberry juice is helpful for urinary infections in pregnancy, multiple studies find.There is a mild preventative effect among children and non-pregnant women with recurrent UTIs ­– but those findings are still provisional.The Facts:Contrary to folk wisdom, many top Google results, including the prestigious-sounding Medical News Today, and the now ubiquitous opinions of ChatGPT, there’s no good evidence that cranberry juice does anything to treat urinary tract infections. That’s the conclusion reached by a high-quality evidence review first published (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001322) back in 1998 and last updated (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001322.pub2) in December 2023. Neither the old nor the updated version found any trials.However, another review, focused on prevention, rather than treatment, did find tons of evidence. Back in 2012, it found (http://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub5) no preventive effect despite the findings of 24 trials with over 4,400 participants. The updated version (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub7) from November 2023 was able to detect a small reduction in urinary tract infection (UTI) rates after the data from another 26 trials were added – but, we probably shouldn’t get too excited just yet.When subgroup analyses were performed, reduced UTI rates were found among women with recurrent UTIs and among children but were not confirmed among elderly inpatients, patients with urinary leakage, and pregnant women. Given an estimated (#the-research) 16% of pregnant women suffer from UTIs (or 20 million people at any given time), this is a disappointing result. Interviews of women who had UTI in pregnancy showed (https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/bde-29996) that this health condition is no minor concern to them; it aches, and the fear of serious harms to the baby is common. The need to take antibiotics worsens (https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13044) the fear and makes (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-019-2451-z) them consider other therapy options, such as cranberry pills.The Evidence:  A reputable Cochrane meta-analysis published (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001322) in 1998 and updated (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001322.pub2) in December 2023 found no trials of cranberry products being used for treating UTIs.  Another Cochrane meta-analysis, updated (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub7) in November 2023, focused on prevention and found a small reduction in UTI rates in those who consumed cranberry juice or cranberry products compared to those who took placebo, water, or no specific prescription.  The certainty of evidence of the preventive effect is moderate, meaning that the estimate of effect might change in the future when new trials are published. This already happened with the 2023 update when it managed to detect the preventive effect of cranberry products, after the original 2012 review, encompassing half as many trials, failed to detect it with moderate certainty.  The evidence is controversial to date for elderly inpatients, patients with urinary leakage, and pregnant women, as there were fewer trials that studied these subgroups.  The lack of preventive effectiveness among pregnant women is important as they suffer from UTIs at a high rate and with additional severity, as studies (#the-research) of women’s lived experience detail.Top hits on Google are ignorant of important evidence.Running a Google search for cranberry + UTIs (https://www.google.com/search?q=cranberry+utis) produces top results, including:  Medical News Today, in their 2016 article (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306498), failed to account for the reputable Cochrane review, which, at that time, showed no evidence of preventive effectiveness of cranberry products. By contrast, the article cherry-picked just one trial (http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2015.04.003) (out of at least 24 known at the time) and suggested that cranberry capsules “reduce the prevalence of UTI.” This is despite their claims of having “strict sourcing guidelines.”  HealthEssentials Cleveland Clinic also failed to acknowledge the Cochrane review in their post on cranberries, published (https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-cranberry-juice-stop-uti) in 2020, claiming, “One 2013 analysis of 13 different trials concluded that cranberry juice and tablets did reduce the occurrence of UTIs compared to placebo in women with recurrent UTIs. But another review found that they didn’t.” Neither reference led to the major Cochrane review. The outlet ended up turning to a doctor who suggested, “Cranberry won’t hurt, but it may help,” ignoring scientific evidence whatsoever.ChatGPT is unaware of the evidence.ChatGPT, asked if cranberries were “effective against urinary tract infections,” told us they are “believed” to have an active compound, proanthocyanidins, but “the evidence regarding the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing or treating UTIs is mixed.” Without actually showing the evidence and discussing its nuance, this is nothing more than a bland statement.When science is done right…During the research for this article, two systematic reviews were encountered, published in the same year, conducted by different teams (one from Australia (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001321.pub7) and the other from the US (https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.46738)), both of which settled on the same three studies as their core evidence base. This is a demonstration of the unique feature of scientific data and processes – the relative independence from the observer. They didn’t have to coordinate their findings; the scientific methodology did that for them.As to the conclusion they concurrently came to, it’s that there are only several randomized trials on the use of cranberry products in pregnant women, and they did not show any reduction in urinary infection rates. Most trials are of poor quality, so odds are the conclusions might change if, theoretically, better studies are conducted in the future. What they did find was high dropout rates (at 30–50%), and the women reported intolerance of the high dosages of cranberry juice they were prescribed. The replacement of juice with pills helped a bit, but the dropout rates were still high – indicating that whatever benefits there may have been were accompanied by inconvenience.The Research:Notes  This post was created by a team of researchers and journalists with the help of multiple generative AI tools.

Everybody else claims beetroot is “powerful” stuff to take before exercise. Is it?

(#citation)Effects of Beetroot Supplements on Muscular PerformanceLots of Studies to Digest on Beetroot, (Not So) SurprisinglySo, a Zheln search (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Z3JU7) located this systematic review on the effects of beetroot, first published (https://doi.org/10.1080/27697061.2023.2211318) online back in May 2023. It seemed fascinating that somebody conducted a scientific investigation centered on beetroot ingestion. However, that review only focused on muscular strength and endurance and only on healthy males, which seemed too restrictive, so I looked up more and broader reviews that focused on muscular and sports performance, exclusive of the effects beetroot has on blood pressure. Perhaps surprisingly, but whenever a new systematic review is published, it is usually the case that it is not the first one, so it is always good practice to lurk more.I also wanted to focus only on those reviews that looked at randomized trials because the effects of beetroot ingestion is a pretty interventional research question, meaning that an experiment can be conducted where a group of people is divided randomly into two, with one group taking actual beetroot juice or supplements and the other one taking a placebo, and nobody knows what the heck they are taking, including any health care staff on-site. That’s a study design called a double-masked placebo-controlled randomized trial, and it’s basically the only study design that has a chance of looking remotely convincing to scientists about causality. And, it’s a commonly used study design in health research actually, so the odds of identifying such studies are pretty good.Instead of looking up individual studies ourselves, Zheln’s strategy (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb) is to make use of systematic reviews of studies already available out there. A systematic review is a sophisticated version of your regular “top 5 smartphones” or “best 10 action movies” kind of study, with a research study of a particular type as their focus of interest and a streak of comprehensiveness in them, instead of selecting the “top” or “best,” but the quality of the included studies is also considered. I used Epistemonikos (https://www.epistemonikos.org/) to look up systematic reviews on beetroot. And, as a pretty illustrative case, 25 reviews mentioning “beetroot” were found (https://www.epistemonikos.org/search?q=beetroot), in addition to the one from May 2023.I reviewed all of these, and 2 additional systematic reviews were worthy of further discussion. One review looked at and did not find (https://doi.org/10.1017/S000711452300034X) any effects of ingesting beetroot or nitrates (yeah, that’s what beetroot is rich in) on body weight, fat mass, and some other body indicators. Based on the quality of the included studies, the review authors had low to moderate certainty in this conclusion (i.e., no effects found), which means more and better research could potentially challenge it in the future. The authors of the other review found (https://doi.org/10.1080/19390211.2021.1939472) some evidence of a small positive impact of beetroot/ nitrate supplementation on muscle recovery 2 to 3 days post-exercise but were not very certain in this conclusion, due to multiple concerns about the quality of the research they examined. Finally, let’s look at that biased review that only considered young healthy males: here they found (https://doi.org/10.1080/27697061.2023.2211318) a small positive influence of beetroot on muscular strength and endurance, and also seemed pretty certain of this finding.International Olympic Committee (Almost) Got It RightIn 2018, the International Olympic Committee listed beetroot under “Supplements with good to strong evidence of achieving benefits to performance when used in specific scenarios,” as a food rich in nitrates. Under “Performance impact,” they referenced 5 randomized trials and 1 additional (https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-016-0617-7) systematic review. In summary, they did find some evidence of some small impacts on performance. Comparing their wording to what we saw above, I would say that their wording is close to accuracy, except that they trusted the evidence too much, not taking study quality issues into account (as also is clear from the “hierarchy of evidence” they presented), so their “good to strong evidence […] in specific scenarios” is in fact “good evidence […] in specific scenarios” at best.It’s worth noting that the trials under consideration in all those papers spanned a huge variety of settings, such as different sports and performance metrics, and different timelines. They were usually very small, only a dozen participants or so, which makes them hardly generalizable to an average folk. Many of the trials also employed crossover between groups, which is a delicate technique that necessitates applying sophisticated analysis methods, which some researchers eventually fail to apply.Examining Top Google Hits on Beetroot: Good Evidence Is Not ThereNow that we are aware of the status quo of evidence about beetroot, let’s look at what the internet has to say about it. The fun start is that one of the top hits (https://www.google.com/search?q=beetroot+gym) on Google’s “beetroot + gym” is actually a systematic review, but it did not limit inclusion to randomized trials and did not perform (https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9010043) quality and certainty of evidence assessment, so shame on Google’s algorithms.Several other top hits from Google are very interesting and controversial:      A blog and shop Vivo Life from January 2023 advertised (https://www.vivolife.co.uk/blogs/news/using-beetroot-powder-before-exercise) beetroot supplements as a “powerful supplement that can benefit athletes and fitness enthusiasts.” It goes on to mention one systematic review (without including a complete reference, though, so I had to guess (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12970-021-00463-z)), and it’s very cool because this is the first time I see this review, despite my efforts above (which just highlights how much there can be out there even on mere beetroot).    Upon examination, this review has a pretty controversial methodology, but it’s still interesting that they found slightly improved peak muscle power after beetroot supplementation. However, “an average of 5%” power increase, as cited by Vivo Life, is not substantiated by the review authors: “an ES [effect size] of this magnitude [Hedge’s G of 0.3, see an explanation here (https://www.statisticshowto.com/hedges-g/)]–which equates to a ~ 5% increase in maximal muscle power–is likely to be of considerable athletic and clinical significance, as previously discussed,” they write. However, this statement is purely speculative, and one of the papers they cite to support it presented (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.niox.2014.08.014) a 4% increase in the setting of a large effect size anyway, not a small one that we have here, and for one particular muscle only, not for “muscle power” in general. Also, the review authors failed to account for the quality of the included studies appropriately, which led to unwarranted certainty in the conclusion.    Vivo Life authors referenced just two other sources of evidence to support their claim, both subpar reviews (one (https://doi.org/10.14336/AD.2017.1207); two (https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12061796)). What I am trying to say is that Vivo Life’s vigorous enthusiasm about beetroot supplements is not supported by solid scientific evidence.    A 2017 article on Delish, another top hit for “beetroot + gym” on Google, claims (https://www.delish.com/kitchen-tools/advice/a53773/eating-this-before-a-workout-could-improve-your-results/) that beetroot will “dramatically boost your workout” (“True story: this food’s hard to beat,” goes the subtitle). They only reference that top-hit (https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9010043), subpar review we already looked at, as well as several non-academic sources, so the claims are, clearly, pretty far from okay.  A 2015 article on the U.S. National Public Radio (NPR) website suggested (https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/10/14/448314966/why-you-might-want-to-be-drinking-beet-juice-at-the-gym) “dramatic power boosts to be gained from beet juice,” drawing extensively on only 3 trials (one (https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.115.002141); two (https://doi.org/10.1139/apnm-2014-0228); three (https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00372.2013)). We have already discussed at length why relying on three trials only is completely inappropriate in this case.  “Verywell Fit articles are reviewed by board-certified physicians and nutrition and exercise healthcare professionals. Medical Reviewers confirm the content is thorough and accurate, reflecting the latest evidence-based research. Content is reviewed before publication and upon substantial updates.” A Verywell Fit article, last updated in July 2023, covered (https://www.verywellfit.com/how-does-beet-juice-improve-athletic-performance-4123855) a multitude of purported beetroot effects, so this largely falls outside of this post’s coverage, but the athletic performance section only referenced the aforementioned top-hit (https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9010043), subpar review and 1 trial (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00421-015-3166-0) – clearly, a poor selection of research.  I was running out of time, so only had a brief look at Washington Post’s 2019 coverage (https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/beet-juice-gains-traction-as-an-evidence-based-aid-for-athletes/2019/03/22/8e93b1cc-45a2-11e9-90f0-0ccfeec87a61_story.html) of the beetroot problem, and the sources covered did not seem to coincide much with those that we covered above. But, this was 2019, so please let me know if you reviewed in more detail and think Washington Post did a great job there.ChatGPT Is Optimistic About Beetroot, But Not Based on EvidenceZheln:is beetroot good before exercise?ChatGPT:Yes, beetroot can be a beneficial food to consume before exercise. Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which the body can convert into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide helps to relax blood vessels, improve blood flow, and increase oxygen delivery to muscles. This can potentially enhance exercise performance, especially during endurance activities.Beetroot juice or whole beets are commonly used for this purpose. Some studies suggest that consuming beetroot about 2-3 hours before exercise may be optimal for maximizing the nitric oxide benefits. However, individual responses can vary, so it's a good idea to experiment with timing and amounts to see what works best for you.It's essential to be aware that beetroot can also have a mild laxative effect in some individuals, so it's a good idea to try it in a controlled manner before a workout to see how your body responds.Always consider your personal preferences, tolerances, and any potential interactions with other foods or medications you may be taking. If you have specific health concerns or conditions, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a nutritionist before making significant changes to your diet.Written in StonePublication Notes  The initial draft of this post was written by Claude 2 AI (https://claude.ai/) was completely rewritten before publication.

(#citation)Effects of Early Education on School ReadinessThe age of entry to school (kindergarten) varies from country to country and can be anywhere between 3 and 7 years. At this age, some kids experience difficulties starting school education, so early education centers exist that provide preschool preparation services, which are supposed to improve school readiness. Thus, this topic impacts more than 100 million (https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/earlychildhooddevelopment) preschool children and their parents worldwide.School readiness can be measured with a number of scales, for example, the IDELA tool (https://idela-network.org/the-idela-tool/) or Larson’s Kindergarten Readiness Test (https://www.google.com/search?q=%22Kindergarten+Readiness+Test%22+Larson). A new study (https://doi.org/10.1002/cl2.1363), published in December 2023, looked at trials that evaluated the effectiveness (and safety!) of early education for improving school readiness, and they identified 32 such trials. The earliest of the trials was published in 1967, and the most recent was published in 2021. Two of the studies were conducted in Canada, one in Pakistan, one in France, and the rest was done in the United States. The types of early education included “Head Start,” “Bright Beginnings,” “Creative Curriculum,” “Montessori,” “PATHS,” and “Tools of the Mind,” among others. The trials encompassed a total of almost 16,900 children and followed them up anywhere from 1 to 6 years, and here is what they found:Compared to visiting daycare without any enriched school readiness curricula, kids who received early education did not differ in school readiness as measured by the above-mentioned standardized tests after 1 year from the start of the trials. Additionally, cognitive and physical development metrics, emotional well-being, and social skills were not different between these groups.Moreover, compared to staying at home without any structured home-based education or being on a waitlist, kids who received early education only differed slightly. Curiously, the cognitive skills were only a quarter-a-point to 6.3 points higher among these children, which could advance them at most one level on the scale used (Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford%E2%80%93Binet_Intelligence_Scales)). Emotional well-being and social skills were no different, and physical development and school readiness were not measured. Also, early education raised the probability of kids receiving a health check-up in one trial, with no information as to how useful these additional visits were.The researchers also noted that most of the current evidence is too uncertain to draw firm conclusions, due to the poor conduct of some of the trials. This means that the conclusions might change if new, better studies are conducted. The authors were moderately certain about only one piece of evidence: the lack of differences in physical development after 1 year spent at a center with enriched curricula compared to those without (1 trial involving 336 children). None of the studies looked at the potential harms of early childhood education, e.g., anxiety.In summary, the benefits of center-based early education programs were negligible for improving school readiness, mostly studied in the U.S. setting. Even though the absence of evidence does not equal the evidence of absence, parents and caregivers should consider the lack of support for the effectiveness and no information about potential adverse effects of early childhood education after the completion of 32 trials.Written in StonePublication Notes  The initial draft of this post was written by Claude 2 AI (https://claude.ai/) and then revised substantially before publication.

(#citation)Anticholinergic Deprescribing and Cognitive Decline RiskOlder adults commonly take multiple drugs at once. Many of them impact a person’s cognition, as is seen, for example, in a commonly misused (https://doi.org/10.1080/02791072.2023.2251985) over-the-counter drug against allergies, diphenhydramine. The combined impact of such medications (that are called anticholinergic) can increase the risk of dementia and lead to other poor health outcomes. An online calculator, which was created to estimate this combined impact, features a list (https://www.acbcalc.com/medicines) of over 170 drugs that possess these properties. Accordingly, current guidelines for health care practitioners include the recommendation (https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97/chapter/Recommendations#medicines-that-may-cause-cognitive-impairment) to try and reduce this burden when prescribing to older adults. In consequence, this topic is massively important and impacts over 500 million (https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/ageing) older people worldwide.Little is known about the barriers and facilitators to successfully reducing this burden. A 2021 study (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11096-021-01293-4) identified two studies that asked a total of 48 health care practitioners about this, and they spoke about many barriers. Importantly, but not unusually, unfortunately, no studies were identified that actually asked the patients or their carers about this problem, how they feel about it, or how they think it could be changed.Eventually, a new study (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD015405.pub2), published in December 2023, reviewed the effectiveness of any measures aimed at the reduction of this kind of drug burden. Only three trials were identified, and all of them looked at medication review and changes by health care teams. However, the data reported were so poor that the researchers could draw no conclusions from it, despite the involvement of a total of almost 300 participants in these trials.In summary, anticholinergic burden is a widely recognized medical problem. Despite that, no evidence is available as to the successes of anticholinergic burden reduction. 300 participants were involved in 3 trials to test that, but the trials did not provide good evidence. No studies have looked at how patients feel about the anticholinergic drug burden.Written in StonePublication Notes  The initial draft of this post was written by Claude 2 AI (https://claude.ai/) and then revised substantially before publication.

PMID: 36417969 (https://pubmed.gov/36417969)Zheln search and selection are based on the original Zheln protocol (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021224418). The procedure itself has evolved since the protocol publication, but the search query (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Z3JU7) and the selection criteria have remained basically the same:  Participants/population: Humans. COVID-19 populations are excluded to avoid duplication of research and focus shift.  Intervention(s), exposure(s): Any intervention into a human life.  Comparator(s)/control: Any intervention into a human life.  Main outcome(s): Any practice-important and question-relevant outcome.Evidence Appraisal  Zheln Review Appraisal in 10 Steps:      ✅ Downloaded from the PubMed Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md) Daily Updates    ✅ Meets Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) True Positive Criteria for Systematic Reviews by Either Title or Abstract?    ✅ Full Text or Other Reports Collected by Zheln    ✅ Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice    ✅ Is Not Duplicate    ✅ Passed Reproducibility Check    ✅ Does Not Have Critical Conduct Flaws    ✅ Liked by Zheln    ✅ Practical Implications Summarized by Zheln    ✅ Appraisal Published    The practical implication is that the placebo effect is a major contributor to the treatment effect of various non-operative interventions for nonspecific neck pain (with or without radiculopathy).The systematic review does not appear to be duplicate at a quick glance. Upon quick PubMed and Google searches, no review seems to be covering the whole of neck pain treatment with a focus on the placebo effect.However, a similar systematic review was published recently by Plener et al. (https://doi.org/10.1097/AJP.0000000000001092), covering only conservative treatment and only radiculopathic cervical pain. Unfortunately, it is paywalled, so I was unable to look into it and gain insights.The review appears to be well-conducted overall.The authors searched all the most important databases:  MEDLINE (PubMed)  EMBASE (Ovid)  CINAHL (EBSCO)  Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro)  World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry PlatformThis randomized trial by Ceniza-Bordallo et al. (https://doi.org/10.5093/clysa2019a23), published in 2019, which I casually came across on the first page of a Google for (neck pain placebo) (https://www.google.com/search?q=neck+pain+placebo), was not included in Hu’s review, and I could not check if it was in the excluded because the authors had not reported the list of exclusions. Alternatively, maybe the search strategy did not capture this trial (this trial appears not to be indexed in PubMed, and the authors only reported their PubMed strategy, so I could not check). Overall, it looks like a good search strategy.Another relevant trial, by Jones et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(23)00404-X), has just been published and was unavailable to Hu et al. at the time of their searches.Just as a remark, no trials of surgical treatments were eventually included in the Hu’s review, although those could have been eligible if had a placebo group. Five randomized trials of surgery vs. non-surgery are known to me at this point, none of which includes a placebo or no-treatment group:      Kadanka Z, Bednarík J, Vohánka S, Vlach O, Stejskal L, Chaloupka R, Filipovicová D, Surelová D, Adamová B, Novotný O, Nemec M, Smrcka V, Urbánek I.

PMID: 32178655; PMCID: PMC7076994.The first two come from a relevant systematic review by Nikolaidis et al. (https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD001466.pub3) (2010). I have also found a follow-up study for Kadaňka’s trial, but I am not sure if anyone looked at its data. Cesaroni et al. was published later and then covered by the review by van Middelkoop et al. (https://doi.org/10.1007/s00586-012-2553-z) (2013). I have found the remaining trials during this research, and van Geest et al. is only a protocol, probably with no results published.Verhagen et al. (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pain.2013.07.022) (2013) found 39 randomized trials of surgery for cervical conditions, but they only looked at the comparison of various surgical techniques between each other (and have not found any evidence of differences whatsoever). Astur et al. (https://doi.org/10.31744/einstein_journal/2022AO6567) (2022) found as many as 65 systematic reviews covering surgical treatment of cervical conditions, but it is unclear how many of those also included nonrandomized trials or found any new randomized trials having a placebo or non-treatment control group.The limitations of the evidence include the high risk of statistical bias in most of the trials included as well as evidence of missing data both within and across trials. All of this means that the effect estimates could be even less extreme in reality.That said, the finding that the placebo effect is a major contributor to the treatment outcomes in neck pain is likely to stand.Evidence Dissemination  In Summary:  Neither the review nor the underlying evidence nor the topic of placebo in neck pain have been widely discussed or disseminated online.  The current most popular resources on neck pain treatment for the general audience do not mention placebo.After looking on Google (https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22The+underappreciated+placebo+effects+and+responses+in+randomized+controlled+trials+on+neck+pain%3A+a+systematic+review+with+meta-analysis%22) and Altmetric (https://www.altmetric.com/details/139921004), I identified no coverage of the given review in any media except for Twitter so far. The Twitter coverage is 30 tweets as of now, which mostly are retweets. As of now, the Altmetric score is 19, which placed the review in the top 10% of all research outputs ever tracked by Altmetric (#1,792,769 of 24,004,724 outputs).The top neck-pain-related webpages retrieved by Google did not mention placebo.Google’s (https://www.google.com/search?q=neck+pain+treatment) disease info snippet and Related questions did not mention placebo or its contribution to the actual observed effects of the treatment for neck pain, nor did Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neck_pain) or the websites of reputable clinics (Mayo Clinic (https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neck-pain/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375587), Cleveland Clinic (https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/symptoms/21179-neck-pain), Harvard Health Publishing (https://www.health.harvard.edu/pain/how-to-soothe-a-sore-neck)), popular portals (Spine-Health (https://www.spine-health.com/conditions/neck-pain/treatment-neck-pain)), and government authorities (NHS (https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/neck-pain-and-stiff-neck/)).Accidentally, I came across links falsely claiming they lead to evidence whereas in fact they do not (MedicalNewsToday (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/opioids-about-as-effective-as-placebo-for-lower-back-and-neck-pain-study-finds), The University of Sydney News (https://www.sydney.edu.au/news-opinion/news/2023/06/29/opioids-no-more-effective-than-placebo-for-acute-back-and-neck-p.html)).Also, on MedicalNewsToday, some external links leading to scientific articles are marked with a tick and a label Trusted Source whereas in fact the articles themselves are not checked, just the journal or resource, which in itself says little about the trustworthiness of the article.ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) (Free Research Preview. May 24 Version) did not mention the importance of the placebo effect in its overview of neck pain treatment:User: what is important to know for the general public about the treatment of neck pain?ChatGPT: When it comes to the treatment of neck pain, there are several important points that the general public should be aware of:1. Identify the cause: Neck pain can have various causes, including muscle strain, poor posture, injury, arthritis, or underlying medical conditions. It is crucial to identify the underlying cause of your neck pain to determine the most appropriate treatment.2. Consult a healthcare professional: If you experience persistent or severe neck pain, it is advisable to consult a healthcare professional, such as a primary care physician, chiropractor, or physical therapist. They can evaluate your condition, provide a diagnosis, and recommend appropriate treatment options.3. Rest and gentle movement: In many cases, rest and avoiding activities that worsen the pain can help alleviate neck discomfort. However, prolonged immobilization can be counterproductive. Gentle neck exercises and stretches recommended by a healthcare professional can help improve flexibility and strength, promoting healing and reducing pain.4. Good posture: Maintaining good posture throughout the day is important for neck health. Avoid prolonged periods of slouching or craning your neck forward while using electronic devices. Ensure that your workstation is ergonomically designed to support proper posture.5. Heat and cold therapy: Applying heat or cold therapy can provide temporary relief for neck pain. Cold packs can help reduce inflammation, while heat packs or warm showers can help relax tense muscles. Alternate between the two as needed, but avoid applying heat or cold directly to the skin to prevent burns or frostbite.6. Over-the-counter pain relief: Non-prescription pain medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can be effective in reducing mild to moderate neck pain. However, always follow the recommended dosage and consult a healthcare professional if you have any concerns or existing medical conditions.7. Physical therapy: For persistent or more severe neck pain, a healthcare professional may refer you to a physical therapist. They can provide targeted exercises, manual therapy, and other modalities to alleviate pain, improve range of motion, and strengthen the neck and supporting muscles.8. Ergonomic adjustments: Making ergonomic adjustments to your workspace, such as using an ergonomic chair, adjusting the height of your computer monitor, and using a supportive pillow, can help reduce neck strain and promote better posture.9. Stress management and relaxation techniques: Emotional stress and tension can contribute to neck pain. Engaging in stress management techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or other relaxation techniques can help reduce overall stress levels and alleviate neck pain.10. Lifestyle modifications: Adopting a healthy lifestyle can contribute to overall well-being and help prevent or manage neck pain. Maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing weight, and avoiding smoking can all promote neck health.Remember, these points provide general guidance, but each individual's situation is unique. It's important to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and treatment options based on your specific condition and medical history.When prompted directly, ChatGPT provided a good overview of the placebo effect in general and in the treatment of neck pain in particular, without a clear focus on the contribution of the placebo effect to the actual treatment effects. As is to be expected of it, ChatGPT does not cite any sources.User: what can you tell about the placebo effect with regard to the treatment of neck pain?ChatGPT: The placebo effect refers to the phenomenon in which a patient experiences a perceived improvement in their symptoms or condition after receiving an inactive treatment or intervention that is presented as an active treatment. In the context of neck pain, the placebo effect can play a role in the perception of pain relief and overall treatment outcomes.Studies have shown that placebos can have a notable impact on pain management, including neck pain. When individuals believe they are receiving a genuine treatment, even if it is a placebo, their brain can release endorphins and other neurotransmitters that contribute to pain relief and a sense of well-being. This response can lead to subjective improvements in pain intensity and functional abilities.In the specific case of neck pain, clinical trials evaluating various treatments often include a placebo control group. Participants in the control group receive an inactive treatment, such as a sugar pill or a sham procedure, while another group receives the active treatment being tested. By comparing the outcomes of the active treatment group to those of the placebo group, researchers can assess the true effectiveness of the treatment beyond the placebo effect.Interestingly, even when participants are fully aware that they are receiving a placebo, they may still experience some level of pain relief. This suggests that psychological factors, such as the patient's belief in the treatment and the therapeutic context, can contribute to the placebo effect.It's important to note that while the placebo effect can produce real improvements in subjective experiences, it does not address the underlying cause of the condition. It may provide temporary relief or enhance the effectiveness of other treatments, but it does not result in long-term healing or resolution of the issue.Healthcare professionals are aware of the placebo effect and strive to distinguish true treatment effects from placebo effects when evaluating the efficacy of interventions. They use rigorous scientific methods, such as randomized controlled trials, to ensure accurate assessments of treatments and to differentiate between actual therapeutic effects and placebo responses.In summary, the placebo effect can have a noticeable impact on the perception of pain relief and treatment outcomes in neck pain. However, it is essential to differentiate between true treatment effects and the placebo response when evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Healthcare professionals rely on scientific research and clinical evidence to guide the selection of appropriate treatments for neck pain.ConclusionIn this Zheln Thread, we have seen a case study of how important health research evidence can be published and rest unused and not disseminated through the most popular media channels. Although a good systematic review has shown that the placebo effect plays a great role in how neck pain treatments are effective in the first place, popular media outlets, as of now, do not cover the role of placebo in neck pain whatsoever, leave alone the evidence from this systematic review.Along the way, we have noticed important flaws in how popular media convey research. Particularly, we have seen how they can mislead the reader into trusting a research study whereas they only assessed the journal where the study had been published, not the study itself. In other instances, they have falsely claimed that the link leads to supporting evidence whereas, upon clicking, there is none.Clearly, important health evidence needs to be brought to daylight. Moreover, popular outlets are no longer efficient in collecting, assessing, and conveying this evidence to the general public. The explosive rise of generative artificial intelligence does not currently lead in the right direction.Here at Zheln, we are determined to fix that. Join us on our way to building the world’s first evidence outlet.How to Stay Tuned Zheln on Instagram’s Threads (https://www.threads.net/@igzheln)The main point of contact for Zheln Threads is Zheln’s Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln).

URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2022/04/06/suppl/.            « Previous Post (https://zheln.com/summary/2021/10/20/suppl/)      Next Post » (https://zheln.com/thread/2023/07/13/1/)      Background to ZhelnPlease refer to the Previous Summary Post (https://zheln.com/summary/2021/10/20/suppl/) for a Short Intro to Zheln. Also, in that post I mentioned that Zheln was going to explore options for tackling the problem that had pushed me to its development. Namely, we do not have a single, most popular resource that every health practitioner would go to and easily retrieve the most recent and carefully examined health information for their needs. Ideally, also, the same resource should have a general audiences section, recognized as the top information provider for public health media. We have no such single best resource, no one-stop-shop option.…But probably such a monopoly is simply not possible on the market?Zheln as ServiceThe principal method that Zheln was built on was searching PubMed (or, alternatively, another search platform) to continuously retrieve newly added records of systematic reviews (as well as other forms of knowledge synthesis (https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/41382.html)). The records found were to be then categorized into medical specialties (to create updated specialty-specific listings for health care professionals), and their associated studies critically appraised to deliver accurate representation of the evidence within to health information users (both pro and general audiences).However, both the technical and business implementation of Zheln has turned out to be deficient. I was working alone, used software inefficiently, and did not manage to secure crowd funding. Also, upon closer review I have come to realize that the existing platforms flourished (as compared to Zheln, at least) and were able do deliver very similar content—we are talking about the Trip (https://www.tripdatabase.com/) database, L·OVE (https://iloveevidence.com/) by Epistemonikos, and Health Evidence (https://www.healthevidence.org/), above all. Incidentally, I have also started to notice other examples of important research duplication (apart from Zheln), and this is the insight that will hopefully have grown into my PhD.Anyway, Zheln does not appear to work as it is, or as described in its current protocol (DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb)) and as registered in its PROSPERO record (CRD42021224418 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=224418)). But that alone should not mean that the principal method for Zheln was wrong, right?  This is where I introduce the concept of Zheln as Service. An organization has contacted me to create content for their public resource for health evidence users. Well, this is exactly what I am going to do: to continue retrieving records from PubMed using the published Zheln methodology (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb) (while likely continuing to report this in the methods GitHub repository for Zheln (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries), in the same way as before, but without publication on  Zheln.com (https://zheln.com)), then select and appraise the records that could be of interest to my commissioner, and, finally, sell my summaries to them. I have already said (https://zheln.com/summary/2021/10/20/suppl/#so-what-are-we-going-to-do-for-crying-out-loud) that I do not worry about the brand­—methods use and their impact is my only concern.This what I think of as Zheln as Service.

As Zheln has been on hiatus since exactly December 30, 2020, due to a lack of funding, nothing new has happened since then. So I am not going to be repetitive and just throwing in some links to the previous materials that fairly describe what was happening on Zheln while it was active:  For the latest account of Zheln, see The 30th Anniversary Summary Post (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/30/1/).  The Running Out of Funds (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/26/2/) summary post—the activity interruption announcement. You can read there that I was planning to keep uploading records, but I was unable to do that too. I am really sorry.  You can find links to all the reviews included in Zheln and selected for appraisal so far in the same Running Out of Funds (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/26/2/) summary post. Alternatively, you can directly search for appraisals (https://zheln.com/search/) or browse appraisals by AMA specialty (https://zheln.com/browse/).Why World EBHC Day?World Evidence-Based Healthcare Day (https://worldebhcday.org/) is a global initiative launched in 2020. The topic for the 2021 campaign is the so-called infodemic (https://www.who.int/health-topics/infodemic) and any ways/experiences of tackling it. I applied for Zheln to become an Evidence Ambassador (https://worldebhcday.org/evidence-ambassadors) for the #WorldEBHCday campaign, and this request was proudly honored.Evidence Ambassadors are supposed to provide insight on or resources for managing the (mis/dis)information overload and raise awareness about any ongoing counter-measures. Honestly, I believe there is essentially one path to raising quality of public health information: to improve quality of the information outgoing from the sources most trusted by the target communities. Alternatively, one could introduce another trusted source. If you look at it, the model is no different from the model for improving quality of any other good or service on the market. As summarized in the seminal book on customer development (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_development), The Startup Owner’s Manual (https://steveblank.com/2012/02/09/two-giant-steps-forward-for-entrepreneurs/) by Steve Blank and Bob Dorf, a new business (or an evidence initiative, in our case) can simply enter an existing market, resegment one, or create a new one. For evidence initiatives, it could mean identifying and influencing the information sources their communities primarily rely on or introducing new ones while making sure to divert attention of the communities.But What Exactly Are We Going to Do?I was very delighted to read a recent post in BMJ Evid Based Med by Kari Tikkinen and Gordon Guyatt about how we should probably put less focus on critical appraisal skills when teaching health care practitioners and talk more about applying point-of-care resources, such as UpToDate (https://www.uptodate.com/) or Medscape (https://www.medscape.com/), as well as lower-level evidence syntheses like systematic reviews. In fact, this has turned out to be the most viable option given limited time capacity and research methodology training of people who deliver health care services every day. Then we, as evidence advocates, should put more resources into keeping these websites and mobile apps updated and readily available and ensuring quality of this information. It is not enough to ensure that this information exists­—we should also ensure it is placed where everyone is likely to retrieve it from. This also goes for health information for general audiences, but implementation seems much more complicated in the latter case.  To wrap up, I think we need a single, most popular resource that every health practitioner would go to and easily retrieve the most recent and carefully examined health information for their needs; ideally it should be routinely available at some static place so that practitioners could plan their continuous medical education activities in advance. Ideally, also, the same resource should have a general audiences section, recognized as the top information provider for public health media. Arguably, there is no such resource today.Cochrane (https://www.cochrane.org/) was viewed as something of this sort by many, but it seems clear to me now that its capacity is not enough these days. Cochrane cannot do everything. Also, we already have wonderful point-of-care resources mentioned earlier, but they are too narrative in general and do not incorporate living evidence syntheses. Among the latter, however, we have the Trip (https://www.tripdatabase.com/) database, L·OVE (https://iloveevidence.com/) by Epistemonikos, Health Evidence (https://www.healthevidence.org/), and mind-blowing COVID-19 resources such as COVID-NMA (https://covid-nma.com/), COVID-19 LNMA (https://www.covid19lnma.com/), and COVID19 Recommendations and Gateway to Contextualization (https://covid19.recmap.org/), to name a few. But despite this variety of options (or rather, probably in part due to it), in my opinion, the problem still stands: we have no single best resource, no one-stop-shop option. Whether we like it or not, people love it when they can find something at the same place at all times­—people like to form habits.So What Are We Going to Do, For Crying Out Loud!?Zheln is going to continue exploring options for putting it all together. Zheln is definitely not dead, but it could take other forms in the future. I am absolutely not worried about the brand—I am only worried about bringing my above-mentioned vision into reality (if it is shared by the community, that is). The more I think about it, the more it seems to me that the logical next step is to perform a scoping review (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-018-0611-x) of existing platforms for ‘universal living overview of health-related’ (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb) information (both practitioner- and lay-oriented) and their relative success. To be even more specific, I am currently looking for PhD opportunities so that I could fund my work and collaborate with professionals in the field more easily. It would be really cool to actually contact the above-mentioned parties and do business with them.Thank You for Being Here, and Happy World Evidence-Based Healthcare Day! 🎉Give Feedback and Spread the Word Email Me (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) about AnythingYou can also easily contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov).

Search for reviews (/search/) now!Also, the studies themselves may be misleading due to various problems arising from their conduct. Any comprehensive analysis of these problems or attempts to reproduce the review findings are rarely undertaken, while Zheln reviews are critically appraised thoroughly with focused replication (please check the academic Zheln protocol (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb) to see for yourself how good our methods are).At the same time, spurious results are easily disseminated in health news. On Zheln, we cautiously propagate only the most credible, hard-won evidence. Watch Zheln Health News videos on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b) or consult the list of reviews currently under appraisal (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/26/2/#list-of-included-studies).Health news agencies are also rarely, if ever, independent entities. In contrast, Zheln is fully affiliation-free, fully open (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects), nonprofit, and supported by crowdfunding only. Please help support Zheln (https://opencollective.com/zheln/donate).

They are different from plain PubMed records in that I’m tagging them with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse Zheln Records by AMA Specialty (/browse/), whereas on PubMed, locating all records relevant to your specialty requires use of very extensive search strategies and is, in practice, unfeasible. Of course, Zheln Record Search (/search/) is also available.  They are added daily (unless PubMed fails, and it does (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov/status/1339909838994862082)), most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews. There are 864 recent systematic review records on Zheln currently.  As you can see from the Zheln appraisal log (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md) and from the flow diagram below (#zheln-flow-diagram), only a (random) fraction of Replicated Systematic Subset records is processed as Zheln Records currently because this is a very high workload (roughly 500 new records daily on average), but not to worry: As soon as I crowd-raise enough money to keep Zheln running ($600/mo) (#help-crowdfund-zheln), I will make artificial intelligence do the stuff (in fact, it could manage even better than I do). This will involve discussions with machine learning specialists in evidence synthesis, such as Iain Marshall (https://twitter.com/ijmarshall), and will allow stable processing of 100% of records.Health Science News  When I skim through the Zheln Records, I select the most appealing systematic reviews, critically appraise and replicate them, and record two-minute summary videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b) targeted at general audiences. At first, I planned to publish these videos daily, but now it is clear it is not feasible at present.  As a rule, I select a review for a critical appraisal with replication when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. COVID-19 publications are not selected (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905).  Crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is also possible.  Some of the appraisals are already available as Health Science News on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b). Also, I make some of these natively available in Russian (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFHaL88JqTZbIIbeQRRwPqK9). Finally, all of these are also available from the Zheln Instagram channel (https://www.instagram.com/igzheln).Scientific Nuts &amp; Bolts  Zheln is not only an affiliation-free, nonprofit, health-educational project but also a formal scientific study.  Read the preprint of the full-featured academic protocol for the Zheln overview of systematic reviews: DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.  It has not been peer-reviewed yet, but I’m eager! I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere (#give-feedback-and-spread-the-word)!  Also, I have started contacting the authors and publishers of the systematic reviews I appraise (first on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov), then, if no answer, by email) to collect more feedback and possibly resolve any content misunderstandings at my end. Please follow me on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov) to engage in public discussions; I’m really looking forward to this!  At last, external peer comments on the project have started to appear at ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346654522_Zhelncom_A_protocol_for_a_universal_living_overview_of_health-related_systematic_reviews/comments).Zheln Flow DiagramThis is the Zheln flow diagram.

They are different from plain PubMed records in that I’m tagging them with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse Zheln Records by AMA Specialty (/browse/), whereas on PubMed, locating all records relevant to your specialty requires use of very extensive search strategies and is, in practice, unfeasible. Of course, Zheln Record Search (/search/) is also available.  They are added daily (unless PubMed fails, and it does (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov/status/1339909838994862082)), most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews. There are 864 recent systematic review records on Zheln currently.  As you can see from the Zheln appraisal log (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md) and from the flow diagram below (#zheln-flow-diagram), only a (random) fraction of Replicated Systematic Subset records is processed as Zheln Records currently because this is a very high workload (roughly 500 new records daily on average), but not to worry: As soon as I crowd-raise enough money to keep Zheln running ($600/mo) (#help-crowdfund-zheln), I will make artificial intelligence do the stuff (in fact, it could manage even better than I do). This will involve discussions with machine learning specialists in evidence synthesis, such as Iain Marshall (https://twitter.com/ijmarshall), and will allow stable processing of 100% of records.Health Science News  When I skim through the Zheln Records, I select the most appealing systematic reviews, critically appraise and replicate them, and record two-minute summary videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b) targeted at general audiences. At first, I planned to publish these videos daily, but now it is clear it is not feasible at present.  As a rule, I select a review for a critical appraisal with replication when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. COVID-19 publications are not selected (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905).  Crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is also possible.  Some of the appraisals are already available as Health Science News on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b). Also, I make some of these natively available in Russian (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFHaL88JqTZbIIbeQRRwPqK9). Finally, all of these are also available from the Zheln Instagram channel (https://www.instagram.com/igzheln).Scientific Nuts &amp; Bolts  Zheln is not only an affiliation-free, nonprofit, health-educational project but also a formal scientific study.  Read the preprint of the full-featured academic protocol for the Zheln overview of systematic reviews: DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.  It has not been peer-reviewed yet, but I’m eager! I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere (#give-feedback-and-spread-the-word)!  Also, I have started contacting the authors and publishers of the systematic reviews I appraise (first on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov), then, if no answer, by email) to collect more feedback and possibly resolve any content misunderstandings at my end. Please follow me on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov) to engage in public discussions; I’m really looking forward to this!  At last, external peer comments on the project have started to appear at ResearchGate (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/346654522_Zhelncom_A_protocol_for_a_universal_living_overview_of_health-related_systematic_reviews/comments).Zheln Flow DiagramThis is the Zheln flow diagram.

They are different from plain PubMed records in that I’m tagging them with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse Zheln Records by AMA Specialty (/browse/), whereas on PubMed, locating all records relevant to your specialty requires use of very extensive search strategies and is, in practice, unfeasible. Of course, Zheln Record Search (/search/) is also available.  They are added daily (unless PubMed fails, and it does (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov/status/1339909838994862082)), most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews. There are 864 recent systematic review records on Zheln currently.  As you can see from the Zheln appraisal log (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md) and from the flow diagram below (#zheln-flow-diagram), only a (random) fraction of Replicated Systematic Subset records is processed as Zheln Records currently because this is a very high workload (roughly 500 new records daily on average), but not to worry: As soon as I crowd-raise enough money to keep Zheln running ($600/mo) (#help-crowdfund-zheln), I will make artificial intelligence do the stuff (in fact, it could manage even better than I do). This will involve discussions with machine learning specialists in evidence synthesis, such as Iain Marshall (https://twitter.com/ijmarshall), and will allow stable processing of 100% of records.Health Science News  When I skim through the Zheln Records, I select the most appealing systematic reviews, critically appraise and replicate them, and record two-minute summary videos (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b) targeted at general audiences.  As a rule, I select a review for a critical appraisal with replication when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. COVID-19 publications are not selected (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905).  Crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is also possible.  Some of the appraisals are already available as Health Science News on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b). Also, I make some of these natively available in Russian (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFHaL88JqTZbIIbeQRRwPqK9). Finally, all of these are also available from the Zheln Instagram channel (https://www.instagram.com/igzheln).Scientific Nuts &amp; Bolts  Zheln is not only an affiliation-free, nonprofit, health-educational project but also a formal scientific study.  Read the preprint of the full-featured academic protocol for the Zheln overview of systematic reviews: DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.  It has not been peer-reviewed yet, but I’m eager! I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere (#give-feedback-and-spread-the-word)!  Also, I have started contacting the authors and publishers of the systematic reviews I appraise (first on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov), then, if no answer, by email) to collect more feedback and possibly resolve any content misunderstandings at my end. Please follow me on Twitter (https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov) to engage in public discussions; I’m really looking forward to this!Zheln Flow DiagramThis is the Zheln flow diagram. It shows the flow of systematic reviews on Zheln since the last summary post (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/16/1/). The flow diagram is modified from the PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by Matthew Page (https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the SRflowdiagram (https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by Neal Haddaway (https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway). I am deeply grateful to the original authors!List of Included StudiesSome of the appraisals are already available as videos on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b), so click the  button next to the appraisal heading to watch them.

Then I posted about it on my health-educational resources in Russian (Telegram (https://t.me/sanktprosvet/225), Instagram (https://www.instagram.com/p/CI68VeWA10G/), VK (https://vk.com/wall-50151591_329)). Also, I asked the subscribers if they wanted an extensive appraisal. As of Dec 19 @ 5am EST, there were 7/9 votes for and 2/9 votes against the extensive appraisal.Full Text &amp; Other Reports Collected by ZhelnSuccessfully collected all three versions of this publication: the current 2020 paper, the outdated 2009 paper, and the 2003 protocol.Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (CV), and rates of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke are of interest. Most of them (save CV mortality) are featured in the review, so yes, it does in theory generate pragmatic practice-relevant evidence.Is Duplicate?Google: systematic review target blood pressure (https://www.google.com/search?q=systematic+review+target+blood+pressure)Some of the top results:  Sakima 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41440-018-0123-4) – full text collected. Not referenced by Arguedas et al., although the research question of Sakima et al. is identical to that of Arguedas et al. Also, of note, this review was first published online on Apr 5, 2019, whereas the searches were conducted on May 28–29, 2019, during the index review conduct.  Reboussin 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000067) — successfully collected the full text with a correction (https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000077). One of the review questions is exactly the same as in the review by Arguedas et al. However, this review is not referenced by the authors of the index review; at the same time, the associated guideline document by Whelton et al. is referenced.These two are important reviews targeting practically the same population, interventions, and outcomes, and they were not referenced by the original authors. Therefore, I first made an assessment that this review was duplicate.However, I felt like another look at the review report was warranted because it is just so hard to presume such ignorance, and found a section discussing previous research. There, several methodological differences between this review and the previous ones were stated, and I found that these differences were also a thing with respect to the two aforementioned reviews. Namely, both Reboussin 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1161/HYP.0000000000000067) and Sakima 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41440-018-0123-4) interpret interventions as more or less intensive, whereas Arguedas et al. look at specific blood pressure (BP) targets. There possibly are more differences, but I believe this is already enough to disprove my previous reservations about the index review duplication.The index review is an update of the previous 2009 review, so it is also worth looking at the reasons for the update, but that’s plain enough because 7 more eligible studies were identified in addition to the 4 earlier trials.Thus, all in all, I don’t see that the review is importantly duplicate.Passed or Failed Replication?  Verbatim search strategies for all major databases searched are available. This facilitates replication.  The search process is not reported in detail; namely, no information is provided regarding the number of references retrieved from each search and details are available as to how these references were merged.  At the same time, I do not have access to all the databases the authors searched (e.g., Embase, ProQuest, Web of Science, etc.).  Therefore, I fail to definitely replicate the initial set of records.  At the same time, I do have access to Scopus whose coverage is somewhat similar to that of Embase.  From the other hand, I do not have access to Ovid, so will need to translate the search strategies. This is usually done inexactly.  Will use Medline Transpose (https://medlinetranspose.github.io/documentation.html) for the MEDLINE searches and manual translation using the official Ovid Embase field guide (https://ospguides.ovid.com/OSPguides/embase.htm) for the Embase searches.  I have already started appraisal of this article and will likely complete it within a couple of days.

They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving most of all systematic reviews being published in peer-reviewed international health care journals.  I’m also tagging the records with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).  Otherwise, you can watch select Zheln records on the YouTube channel for Zheln (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ). Since recently, I have started to publish critical appraisal videos daily.  Read the full-featured academic protocol for Zheln here for free: DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.  I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere!Zheln Flow DiagramThis is the Zheln flow diagram. It shows the flow of systematic reviews on Zheln since the last summary post (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/12/2/).The flow diagram is modified from the PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by Matthew Page (https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the SRflowdiagram (https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by Neal Haddaway (https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway). I am deeply grateful to the original authors!List of Included StudiesAs a rule, I select a review for a critical appraisal with replication when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities.

As a result, I miss some appraisal days (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), usually don’t appraise 100% of daily records (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), and the amount of time I spend on Zheln activities (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) has varied.  So, in this regard, I have chosen to follow the Okazaki-fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragments) (or conveyor-belt) strategy: whenever I miss any record-processing, I usually do not go back but proceed further. These records may still be processed but only after all current work is done. I believe this is most appropriate for Zheln, due to its very living nature and in order to achieve steady current processing.  Also, record-screening and specialty-tagging are very resource- and time-intensive and plain boring, while, at the same time, they could perfectly be automated using artificial neural networks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).  As soon as I crowd-raise enough money to keep Zheln running ($600/mo) (#help-crowdfund-zheln), I will start integrating machine learning into record-screening and specialty-tagging. This will involve discussions with machine learning specialists in evidence synthesis, such as Iain Marshall (https://twitter.com/ijmarshall), and will allow stable processing of 100% records.  As to the amount of time I spend on Zheln, this is the best I can currently do due to the health restrictions I wrote about earlier (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-going-on).Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding OnlyRunning Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.If you want Zheln to live on, please use one of these options:Subscribe for $1/mo to $600/mo on  Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln),  GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln) Send Any Amount via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln) Email Me (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) About AnythingYou can also easily contact me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov). Bonus for Star Wars Fans!Zheln subscription enables you to change the icon of a given Zheln record to a Star Wars symbol of your choice!

I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand. I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere!  There are 736 recent systematic review records on Zheln currently. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving most of all systematic reviews being published in peer-reviewed international health care journals.  I’m also tagging the records with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).  Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for Oct 30 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), Oct 31 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), Nov 10 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 13 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 20 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), Nov 21 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), Nov 22 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/), Nov 25 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/25/), Nov 27 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/27/), or Dec 9 (https://zheln.com/2020/12/09/) records.  Otherwise, you can watch Zheln records on the YouTube channel for Zheln (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, Oct 31 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and Nov 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM), and Nov 25 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ePQA5-peE) videos are available). Since recently, I endeavor to publish one video-recorded critical appraisal of an important systematic review daily; however, I have not been successful at this yet (two videos are available by now, please see the links in the appraisal list below (#list-of-included-studies)).  Also, I do miss some appraisal days (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), and the amount of time I spend on Zheln activities (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) has varied. I have chosen to follow the Okazaki-fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragments) (or conveyor-belt) strategy in this regard: whenever I missed any record processing, I usually do not go back but proceed further. These records may still be processed but only after all current work is done. I believe this is most appropriate for Zheln, due to its very living nature and in order to achieve steady current processing. In the future, however, when more staff (more than only me) is available, Zheln will definitely go stable.List of Included StudiesAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. COVID-19 publications are not selected (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905). However, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.Some of the appraisals are already available as videos on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ), so click the  button next to the appraisal heading to watch them!

Some claim such diets are bad for their health, others claim otherwise. So when I saw a recent review by Baroni and coauthors, I took it for a critical appraisal. I thought it would be of help, as it did feature practice-relevant maternal outcomes, such as the rate of pregnancy weight gain, mental problems, complications, or gestational diabetes.However, during the appraisal, I found multiple previous reviews on the same topic, but Baroni and coauthors did not seem to fully take these into account. In other words, their review turned out to be duplicate, at least in part, and, therefore, is not a good candidate to start examining the problem with.If you still want me to go on with it and report on vegetarian diets in pregnancy, crowdfunding an appraisal is an option at Zheln.com.Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?CDC lists (https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/maternalinfanthealth/index.html) the following maternal outcomes:  Pregnancy Complications  Diabetes During Pregnancy  Weight Gain During Pregnancy  Substance Use During Pregnancy  Depression Among Women  Maternal MortalityThe review does address some of these outcomes, so yes, it should in theory generate practice-important evidence.Is Duplicate?Google: “systematic review” vegetarian mother OR maternal (https://www.google.com/search?q=%22systematic+review%22+vegetarian+mother+OR+maternal)  Tan 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.1461062) – both infant and maternal outcomes; vegetarian during pregnancy only, whereas Baroni et al. feature the breastfeeding period too. Referenced by Baroni et al. but cursorily only; no statement is given as to how the review is importantly different to Tan 2019 (https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2018.1461062).  Piccoli 2015 (https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.13280) – both infant and maternal outcomes; during pregnancy only; not only vegetarian but also vegan. Not referenced by Baroni et al.  Oussalah 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clnu.2020.02.037) – any health outcomes. Not referenced by Baroni et al. It’s quite recent (epub Mar 2020) but could be identified by the authors.  etc.Overall, I feel this review is at least partly duplicate; no due attention is paid in regard to previous studies on the topic. Therefore, this review is not a good place to start examining the topic, so will not appraise further.  I have already started appraisal of this article and have found there is evidence that this study is duplicate research. Therefore, assessing comprehensively the problem in question will not be limited to assessing this study only and will take considerable time and effort. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on GitHub (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/master/_posts/record/2020/12/12/2020-12-12-62.md) as I do the appraisal.

Would it not be better for the baby if her mother had more trees, and grass, and other greenery around while carrying her? A recent review by Hu and coauthors looked at adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as the rate of preterm birth or low birth weight, and checked if the amount of greenness around the mother’s home could predict them.Plants absorb visible light because they need it to photosynthesize oxygen. At the same time, plants reflect infrared light because it would heat and hurt them in the same way a hot radiator could. In contrast, inorganic land surfaces mostly reflect visible light but absorb infrared light. This is why we can easily differentiate between those by just taking pictures of Earth from satellites.This is what most previous reviews on the topic looked at—this index of greenness, using sophisticated statistics to measure its association with birth outcomes. The review by Hu and coauthors continues on this path and takes into account all bleeding-edge research on the topic. However, I could not access all the information needed to check the review findings because of the publisher’s paywall.Therefore, if you want me to go on with this appraisal and report on the effect of residential vegetation on pregnancy outcomes, please help me collect these data or crowdfund their collection at Zheln.com.Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?Preterm birth rate, low birth weight rate, and infant mortality are usually listed as adverse birth outcomes. These are clearly patient-important too. The review features some of these, so it does in theory generate practice-important evidence.Is Duplicate?I ran a low-effort Google search: green urban preterm birth meta analysis OR metaanalysis (https://google.com/search?q=green+urban+preterm+birth+meta+analysis+OR+metaanalysis). Some very similar reviews (and recent too) instantly showed (Akaraci 2020 (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082949); Lee 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00649-z)). I successfully collected all the full texts. The authors do reference Akaraci 2020 (https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17082949) at multiple places throughout the report despite it being a very recent study (April 2020); this is commendable. However, they do not reference Lee 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00649-z), but this is an even more recent study (August 2020). Also, no registration info is available from Lee 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12940-020-00649-z), nor does it show up in the PROSPERO advanced search (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#searchadvanced) results. Three records were found there for birth AND (green*):TI:  Green spaces and birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [CRD42020177721 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020177721)] – it’s the registration by Hu et al. themselves.  Influence of Residential Greenness on Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Dose-response Meta-analysis [CRD42020162387 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020162387)] — I located and collected the report full text (Zhan 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137420)); this study is also notably referenced by Hu et al. despite it being very recent (May 2020).  The health benefits of the great outdoors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of greenspace exposure and health outcomes [CRD42015025193 (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42015025193)] — I located and collected the report full text (Twohig-Bennett 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.030)); this study is not referenced by Hu et al. However, reading the Twohig-Bennett 2018 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2018.06.030) report showed that this review explicitly excluded birth outcomes, so was in fact irrelevant.From the aforementioned Google search, I also identified closely related reviews by Porpora et al. (2019) (https://doi.org/10.3390/toxics7010011) and Bekkar et al. (2020) (https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.8243) (with a correction (https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.14510); all full texts collected by Zheln). These are also not referenced by Hu et al. Notably, Bekkar 2020 is another ongoing appraisal on Zheln (https://zheln.com/record/2020/11/20/429/), so have a look at it too. Anyway, in contrast to other reviews mentioned previously, these two reviews are actually not about greenery but about environmental hazards, such as air pollution. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the topic in question.At last, Dzhambov 2014 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2014.09.004) was cited in some of the reports. It was probably the first systematic review on this topic. I have collected its full text too.The general design layout of these relevant reviews is taking satellite measurements of environmental greenness (usually in the form of NDVI (https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php)) around the mother’s home location, on the one hand, and either birth weight or some bad-pregnancy-outcome rate, on the other hand, and calculating associations between the two variables using meta-analysis. Also, various confounders are usually accounted for in the calculation model.So what’s so new about the review by Hu et al.? It appears that the methods were somewhat different from before and some new studies were taken into account. The authors provided a clear explanation about that. Okay, so this is not duplicate then.Passed or Failed Replication?No supplementary data, that reportedly contain full search strategies, is available to me because of the paywall, so I can’t replicate the searches.Clearly, this is not a problem of the study, but this is a paywall problem. Still, I can’t go on with the appraisal without these data. I’ll be able to go on once I get these supplementaries.  I have already started appraisal of this article and have not been able to replicate it. Replicability (reproducibility) is a must-have for a great systematic review, but sometimes it is compromised mostly by bad reporting. Therefore, assessing this review comprehensively will require me to make every effort to collect all available study records, including contacting the authors, and will take considerable time. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on GitHub (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/master/_posts/record/2020/12/11/2020-12-11-26.md) as I do the appraisal. Also, you can look for similar systematic review appraisals using search (/search/) or by tapping on AMA specialty tags (/browse/) at the bottom of this page or in the side menu.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  By all means, you are always welcome reaching out to me for whatever reason by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov).

This was in part due to the fact I was busy translating the PRISMA 2020 Statement into Russian (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/QDMU6). Also, there was an error on the PubMed’s side (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/1437378525fc5d1e4699684daf7b355982fb796c#diff-04c804c0b51cb403b67bc0d5d2764aaaed608691df259a8fb588b610f57d2ba6) that prevented records from retrieval and now seems to be fixed (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/c2950764a4acbb6c81257ab7bdf08e3c547c2178#diff-04c804c0b51cb403b67bc0d5d2764aaaed608691df259a8fb588b610f57d2ba6); I inquired of NCBI about it by email but received no response yet.Status Description            Work Schedule (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/Work_Schedule.md)      Worked-Time Target (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md)      Appraisal Log (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md)        Read the full-featured academic protocol for Zheln here for free: DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand. I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere!  There are 723 recent systematic review records on Zheln currently. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving most of all systematic reviews being published in peer-reviewed international health care journals.  I’m also tagging the records with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).  Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for Oct 30 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), Oct 31 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), Nov 10 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 13 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 20 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), Nov 21 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), Nov 22 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/), Nov 25 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/25/), or Nov 27 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/27/) records.  Otherwise, you can watch Zheln records on the YouTube channel for Zheln (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, Oct 31 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and Nov 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM), and Nov 25 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ePQA5-peE) videos are available). Since recently, I endeavor to publish one video-recorded critical appraisal of an important systematic review daily (two videos are available yet, please see the links in the appraisal list below (#list-of-included-studies)).  Unfortunately, due to very high load of records, I do miss some appraisal days (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), and the amount of time I spend on Zheln activities (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) has varied. I have chosen to follow the Okazaki-fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragments) (or conveyor-belt) strategy in this regard: whenever I missed any record processing, I usually do not go back but proceed further. These records may still be processed but only after all current work is done. I believe this is most appropriate for Zheln, due to its very living nature and in order to achieve steady current processing. In the future, however, when more staff (more than only me) is available, Zheln will definitely go stable.List of Included StudiesAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. COVID-19 publications are not selected (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905). However, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.Some of the appraisals are already available as videos on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ), so click the  button next to the appraisal heading to watch them!

You can find and read it here for free: DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.  I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do engage me on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere!  There are 723 recent systematic review records on Zheln currently. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.

Since recently, I endeavor to publish one video-recorded critical appraisal of an important systematic review daily (two videos are available yet, please see the links in the appraisal list below (#list-of-included-studies)).  Unfortunately, due to very high load of records, I do miss some appraisal days (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), and the amount of time I spend on Zheln activities (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) has varied. I have chosen to follow the Okazaki-fragments (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragments) (or conveyor-belt) strategy in this regard: whenever I missed something, I usually do not go back but proceed further. I believe this is most appropriate for Zheln, due to its very living nature. In the future, however, when more staff (more than only me) is available, Zheln will definitely go stable.List of Included StudiesAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities.

They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving most systematic reviews being published in peer-reviewed international health care journals.  As this is tens of thousands of records a month, I’m currently struggling to process random 10% of Zheln records daily (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening). Follow appraisal progress using my open performance metrics (#my-performance-metrics) below.  I’m also tagging the records with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).  Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for Oct 30 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), Oct 31 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), Nov 10 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 13 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 20 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), Nov 21 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), Nov 22 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/), or Nov 25 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/25/) records.

They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving most systematic reviews being published in peer-reviewed international health care journals.  As this is tens of thousands of records a month, I’m currently struggling to process random 10% of Zheln records daily (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening). Follow appraisal progress using my open performance metrics (#my-performance-metrics) below.  I’m also tagging the records with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).  Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for Oct 30 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), Oct 31 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), Nov 10 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 13 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 20 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), Nov 21 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), or Nov 22 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/) records.  Otherwise, you can watch Zheln records on the YouTube channel for Zheln (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, Oct 31 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and Nov 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM) video summaries are available).List of Included StudiesAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities.

This is why I’m going to assign short titles to the records selected for full appraisal only. Also, I’m going to finally start full appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/714748ca646d2d3582625f481e0e0f01380fb8a4/README.md#full-appraisal-stage).  As to the rest of the records, I’m going to assign them tags taken from the newly-developed tag list (not published yet). AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/714748ca646d2d3582625f481e0e0f01380fb8a4/README.md#specialty-tagging) will have to be dropped.  In the end, I’m going to review all these records in videos recorded daily (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ). In addition, I have already got enough content to record the Nov 13 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), Nov 20 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), Nov 21 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), and Nov 22 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/) videos, so I’m going to do this too.  As to the full-featured academic protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the Zheln nonprofit business plan (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4), I’m not ready to write up these yet as Zheln production process is still unstable. Current methods are available from the Zheln methods repository (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/714748ca646d2d3582625f481e0e0f01380fb8a4/README.md).Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding OnlyRunning Zheln takes most of my work capacity.

Only the summarized results are reported, so this is not replicable.  I have already started appraisal of this article and have not been able to replicate it. Replicability (reproducibility) is a must-have for a great systematic review, but sometimes it is compromised mostly by bad reporting. Therefore, assessing this review comprehensively will require me to make every effort to collect all available study records, including contacting the authors, and will take considerable time. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on GitHub (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/master/_posts/record/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-67.md) as I do the appraisal.

I have already started appraisal of this article and have found there is evidence that this study is duplicate research. Therefore, assessing comprehensively the problem in question will not be limited to assessing this study only and will take considerable time and effort. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on GitHub (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/master/_posts/record/2020/11/25/2020-11-25-139.md) as I do the appraisal. Also, you can look for similar systematic review appraisals using search (/search/) or by tapping on AMA specialty tags (/browse/) at the bottom of this page or in the side menu.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.

URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/18/1/.Status Report  There are 306 recent systematic review records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving most systematic reviews being published in peer-reviewed international health care journals.  As this is tens of thousands of records a month, I’m currently struggling to process random 10% of Zheln records daily (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).  I’m also tagging the records with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.  Follow the updates watching short day-by-day videos on the YouTube channel for Zheln (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, Oct 31 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and Nov 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM) video summaries are available), browsing Zheln by AMA Specialty (/browse/), or using Zheln free-text search (/search/).

The full-featured academic protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the Zheln nonprofit business plan (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4) will be published for Zheln Primary Appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#primary-appraisal-stage) first. I cannot provide you with any date yet.  Once I’ve streamlined primary appraisals, I will publish a protocol for Full Appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#full-appraisal-stage) and start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few select reviews (#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.Appraisals in ProgressAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.Alternatively, you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for Oct 30 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), Oct 31 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), Nov 10 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), or Nov 13 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/) records.

URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/14/2/.Status Report  There are 259 recent systematic review records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  Moreover, I annotated most of them with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.  So you can browse Zheln by AMA Specialty (/browse/) or use free-text search (/search/). Also, you can watch short day-by-day video updates on the YouTube channel for Zheln (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, Oct 31 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and Nov 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM) video summaries are available).  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing tens of thousands of records per month, of which I’m currently struggling to process 10% daily (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).  However, I’ve been persistently failing my worked-time target (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1e12a395a75d86af4c46811b5e93411aac56b4b4/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) as well as my working schedule (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/07/2/#status-report). Also, summary posts and videos have often been overdue.  Fortunately, there has been an identifiable positive trend in my performance since the previous summary, which you can examine in more detail using the flow diagram below, modified from the PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by Matthew Page (https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the SRflowdiagram (https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by Neal Haddaway (https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway) (see the previous diagram (https://zheln.com/flow-diagram/2020-11-11-1.png) for comparison).  These improvements became possible in part because of the layered appraisal process (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#primary-appraisal-stage) I introduced. It allows me to release records at earlier appraisal states.  The full-featured academic protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the Zheln nonprofit business plan (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4) will be published for Zheln Primary Appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#primary-appraisal-stage) first. I cannot provide you with any date yet.  Once I’ve streamlined primary appraisals, I will publish a protocol for Full Appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#full-appraisal-stage) and start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few select reviews (#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.Appraisals in ProgressAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.Alternatively, you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for Oct 30 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), Oct 31 (https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), or Nov 10 (https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/) records.

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/11/1/.Status Report  There are 179 recent systematic review records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  Moreover, I annotated all of them with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.  So you can browse Zheln by AMA Specialty (/browse/) or use free-text search (/search/).  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing tens of thousands of records per month, of which I’m currently struggling to process 10% daily (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).  However, I’ve been persistently failing my worked-time target (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f7c6f3d5362942865bd4ba61e302cae1acdc642c/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) as well as my working schedule (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/07/2/#status-report).  In particular, I have conducted no new appraisals since the last summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/07/2/).  You can examine my performance since the previous summary in more detail using the flow diagram below, modified from the PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by Matthew Page (https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the SRflowdiagram (https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by Neal Haddaway (https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway).Come On, Man!  I already wrote about the reasons for my stalling (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-going-on).  Still, I haven’t figured out how to get out of this situation, so please keep following my progress and get back for updates on Sat, Nov 14 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/56); it’s really hard on me, believe me.  I’m planning to start posting videos (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/87) reporting day-by-day progress. Moreover, I’m starting to feel this could give me the right impact to streamline appraisals.  Please follow my YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) and TikTok (https://tiktok.com/@drzhelnov) accounts to catch the upcoming updates.  The full-featured academic protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the Zheln nonprofit business plan (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4) will be published separately for Zheln Primary and Full Appraisals. I can’t give you the dates yet, so please stay tuned too.  Once I’ve finalized the protocols, I will also start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few select reviews (#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.Appraisals in ProgressAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.Alternatively, you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/88)—preview how it would look like for Oct 30 records (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/).

If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make.

They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.  Moreover, I annotated all of them with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.  So you can browse Zheln by AMA Specialty (/browse/) or use free-text search (/search/).  These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing tens of thousands of records per month, of which I’m currently struggling to process 10% daily (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).  In the previous Zheln summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/04/1/), I wrote about my persistently bad performance as well as the reasons for it.  Sadly, it has not changed much.  You can examine my performance in more detail using this freshly-cut flow diagram, modified from the PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint (https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by Matthew Page (https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the SRflowdiagram (https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by Neal Haddaway (https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway):  In total, as of now, I have 1,017 records of debt. Also, as you can see (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b96852232d9e80babf7356497a947175b064ab7a/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md), I worked for only about 24 hours this week while I should have worked for 48 hours in total or twice more.  Honestly, I’m not quite sure how to proceed. So I guess, for now, I’ll just keep appraising records and watching how it goes.  Also, I want to modify and better specify my weekly schedule while also maintaining the 120 records of debt per week (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-gonna-happen-in-november) target.      Here is what my new schedule will look like:          Sun (Sun 7am EST – Mon 7am EST): 10% Fri.      Mon (Mon 7am EST – Tue 7am EST): 10% Sat and 10% Sun.      Tue (Tue 7am EST – Wed 7am EST): 10% Mon + Wed summary. Wed summary should report: Fri, Sat, Sun, and Mon.      Wed (Wed 7am EST – Thu 7am EST): 10% Tue.      Thu (Thu 7am EST – Fri 7am EST): 10% Wed.      Fri (Fri 7am EST – Sat 7am EST): 10% Thu + Sat summary. Sat summary should report: Tue, Wed, and Thu.      Sat (Sat 7am EST – Sun 7am EST): day off.        I’m still planning to start posting YouTube videos (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/87) reporting day-by-day progress, but I really want to stay focused on the appraisals for the time being, so it will wait.  And so will the full-featured academic protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the Zheln nonprofit business plan (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4). It is of note, however, that I’m thinking about publishing the protocols for Zheln Primary and Full Appraisals separately to expedite publication of the first formal protocol for Zheln.  Once I’ve finalized the protocols, I will also start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few select reviews (#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.  Finally, I must acknowledge a concurrent project: the translation of the PRISMA 2020 (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/P93GE) into Russian. It will also take much of my time, so some corrections to the Zheln schedule will likely be necessary.  From the other hand, I’m planning to run a separate campaign to crowdfund my translation (https://zhelnov-to-editors.github.io/), that could also raise awareness of Zheln as a by-product.Appraisals in ProgressAs a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.Alternatively, you can browse appraisals by AMA Specialty (/browse/).Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is under development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/88)—preview how it would look like for Oct 30 records (https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/).

Highlights      I have failed you Anakin to complete the Zheln protocol by the end of October    However, failures are a good thing preventing Zheln from launching too early    That’s why I’m spending November appraising records and closing appraisal debts    I’ll get back to writing the protocol &amp; business plan once I feel I can manage    The Mandalorian Chapter 9 is airing!  Where Is the Protocol?  In the previous Zheln summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/), I wrote I was about to write the protocol by today, Oct 31.  However, I haven’t done it.  Also, I wrote some record appraisal debt had accumulated. Here, too, not only haven’t I closed it yet but have also let it grow further.What’s Going On?  Effectively, I’ve been feeling somewhat depressed about all of it.  Coupled with worries about longevity of Zheln, lack of funding for 2021, zero public interest in the project so far, and relapses of my atopic dermatitis debilitating and turning my daily sleep into a mess, it has become the thing preventing me from moving on.  As this is an absolutely destructive way of running Zheln, today, I’m voting for a change.What’s Gonna Happen in November?  I have calculated (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?page=2&amp;q=appraise+is%3Aissue+created%3A2020-10-16..2020-10-30+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+-closed%3A%3C%3D2020-10-30) there is currently a debt of 694 records (assuming the 10%-per-day appraisal rate (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening)).  My pragmatic median primary record appraisal (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#staged-record-appraisal) time is 6 minutes (measurement 1 (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/8422dce13da694cee3097194969749360df27095); measurement 2 (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/c27e551802bec6501377c120dc13dc6a41f8dcfe); measurement 3 (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/248d7df31f1a35023b1db82afc320cc69d86bb9a)).  At the same time, my target average daily work capacity on Zheln, with no full appraisals currently possible while the registration in PROSPERO (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) is pending because reviews that have started data extraction are not accepted for registration (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#aboutregpage), is 6 hours a day (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening) except on Saturdays (days off).  Therefore, assuming eight work hours a day, I should be able to appraise 20 additional records daily.  Overall, this amounts to 35 workdays or six weeks to get out of the record appraisal debt.  So, to ensure stability, 120 records of debt should be appraised by the end of each week. I’ve already set these milestones on GitHub (Nov 8 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/38); Nov 15 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/39); Nov 22 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/40); Nov 29 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/41); Dec 6 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/42); Dec 13 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/43)).  Obviously, I can’t influence my dermatitis and sleep issues much (as I’m already receiving all available treatments), so some changes to this schedule may be necessary. Anyway, that’s what agile planning we’re using (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects) is there for, and summary posts twice a week, that have been published persistently for five weeks in a row (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=summary+on+site+%26+socials+is%3Aissue+closed%3A2020-09-27..2020-10-30+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+) now, will stand.  As to the Zheln protocol (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) and nonprofit business plan (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36) writing, I’m not able to do it now. First, I’m going to be totally busy appraising records, and I don’t want to ruin that. Second, I just can’t be sure I’m really able to run Zheln in a long term unless I have demonstrated I’ve got out of the debt and have been following the appraising schedule consistently for a considerable period.  Thus, I’m going to focus on achieving stable 10%-per-day appraisal rates and appraisal-debt recovery in November.  If I feel the appraisal pace has strengthened enough, and if I have time to spare, I’ll get back to writing the Zheln Manual early. The first thing will be conducting pilot full appraisals to break down the full-appraisal process.  Overall, I feel this downward slope in the Zheln’s life is a good thing because it is a great test of the project survival.Status Report  No new appraisals have been conducted on Zheln since the last summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/).  Please consult the latter for current lists of appraisals in progress (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/#appraisals-in-progress) and appraisals with missing full texts (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/#full-text-wanted).See You Around, Peer Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Wed, Nov 4 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/44)Email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov)Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding OnlyRunning Zheln takes most of my work capacity.

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln), GitHub Sponsors (https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or Open Collective (https://opencollective.com/zheln). Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/21/1/.What Does Zheln Give You?There are 123 recent systematic review records on the Zheln website (https://zheln.com) now, most published this fall, added daily, each:  Counting as a true positive by Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews (means they, indeed, are systematic).  Annotated with AMA specialty tags (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the AMA Physician Masterfile (https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.As a result, you can enjoy a current and Open Access (https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access) directory of the most recent systematic reviews in any AMA specialty on their respective specialty pages (https://zheln.com/browse/).In the near future, as soon as I register an academic protocol (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) for this project, thorough critical appraisals of a few select reviews (#appraisals-in-progress) will also become publicly available. As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities.Also, crowdfunding an appraisal (#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible—and most welcome, too, actually, as Zheln is running out of funds and will shut down by the end of 2020 unless crowdfunded (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/32#issue-713953526).Where Are These Records From?These records came from my Replicated Systematic Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query that differs from the regular PubMed Systematic Reviews Filter (https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html) query in that it:  Incorporates the more sensitive, legacy February 2017 version (http://web.archive.org/web/20181023065423/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html) of the query.  Allows for more precise replication of the record subset.In one and a half months from Sep 1 to Oct 19, 2020, the query produced the appalling 23,827 records. 😱Of these thousands of records, I appraised 158 records (0.6%) to date. But for the last four days since the latest summary post (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/), I’ve been appraising sixteen times more or 10% daily (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2020-10-16..2020-10-21+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and will keep up the pace (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E%3D2020-10-16+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+).Of the records appraised, in turn, 35 records (22%) did not meet the Shojania &amp; Bero 2001 criteria (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#record-screening) and were excluded from further processing. However, they are still accessible on the Zheln website via the search box (https://zheln.com/search/).What Is Zheln, Honestly?I named the project after the zhelna, the black woodpecker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_woodpecker), who do the same thing I do: Hit to the core.

Zheln was conceived on Sep 2, 2020, taking over from a 2019 project (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#what-is-this-repo) that aimed to discover all orthopedic systematic reviews on PubMed (https://pubmed.gov).  Eventually, this affiliation-free, crowdfunded, open-science (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.032) initiative that aims to monitor, critically appraise, and tag with AMA specialties (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) all new systematic reviews (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#record-screening) that are indexed on PubMed (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#pubmed-search) was first widely published (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/20/1/).  I produced this website (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#general-status) and established biweekly status reports (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestones?state=closed), but the appraisal count remained low (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#why-so-few) because of the overwhelming number of records to appraise.  Then I started introducing control measures (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#how-are-the-appraisals-going), that did prove effective (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/03/2/). However, the workload was still too high (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/07/1/), so that, at times, distress prevailed (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/10/2/).  I did invite collaborators (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#bonus) and even took part in a hackathon (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/milestone/1); however, no one’s showed up yet. Crowdfunding (#help-crowdfund-zheln), too, is lacking.  Eventually, I realized I needed to write up a thorough nonprofit plan (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/14/1/#lieutenant-general-status) in addition to an academic paper (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#academic-status). Both of these are currently in development (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4).There Has Been an Awakening  As I wrote previously (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/14/1/#lieutenant-general-status), the estimated crowdfunding amount required to accomplish the Zheln’s mission (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#zhelns-mission) is way too high for the start.  But since then, I’ve found a way to stay on budget (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720).  To do that, I reduced the workload to 10% (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/7ada9d590e08811142385a92ee50e79195084c38) while, at the same time, following a tight schedule (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/22) and dropping older unappraised records (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/44).  This movement has already proved highly effective (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/23?closed=1).  Indeed, it would allow to appraise not all records but just one tenth of them; however, this is for starters, and this solution seems highly scalable when Zheln becomes adequately crowdfunded.  Overall, it would take me around five hours daily (except on a Saturday, a day off) to be on schedule.  And that’s great because I still have one hour to spend on the website maintenance incl. summary posts (estimated 30 hours a month in total) and two more hours a day to conduct full appraisals.What’s the Next Move?  New record uploads have been restarted and the appraisal process has been put on schedule.  As previously mentioned (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals), I’m not doing full appraisals until I’ve established stable record triage (which, as it appears (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/23?closed=1), I did).  Also, I need to write and register the protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) before I can embark on full appraisals.  However, as I see it now, several full appraisals still need to be conducted now as a piloting exercise (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/3#issuecomment-706716950) exactly because I need to carefully design the whole Zheln process to write the protocol and the Zheln Manual (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36).  Therefore, I will now move to full appraisals, which, of note, consist of 18 records awaiting (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Legacy_Appraisals_Table.md) and are expected to grow, as the estimated number needed to appraise before one record is selected for full appraisal features roughly every eighth record.  Expect a report on how full appraisals are going in the next summary post on Wed, Oct 21 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/24)!See You Around, Peer Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Wed, Oct 21 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/24)Email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov)Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding OnlyRunning Zheln takes most of my work capacity.

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription (https://patreon.com/zheln) on Patreon. Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Highlights      New record uploads have been halted while I do administrative work    However, older records get appraised in the process    The protocol has been extended to a full nonprofit business plan—The Zheln Manual    Struggling to publish and register the Manual in PROSPERO by the end of October  New Appraisals in Progress  How good is C-reactive protein measurement with regard to health outcomes (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/10/)?  What is the association between sugar-free gum and dental caries (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/21/)?

How effective is empathy training in health care education (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/37/)?  What are the current therapeutic applications of human mesenchymal stem cells (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/45/)?

How useful is physical exercise for people living with breast cancer (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/47/)?General Status  No new records have been downloaded from PubMed since the last summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/10/2/).  However, I have finally conducted primary appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#staged-record-appraisal) of 67 older records (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/30), which is the largest appraisal session on Zheln to date; accordingly, there has been a major update on the Zheln website.  In addition to the three full systematic review appraisals featured earlier (two (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals) + one (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/07/1/#general-status)), there are now six more (#new-appraisals-in-progress)! Also, two more (#full-text-wanted) were selected but are lacking full text. Please contact me (#see-you-around-peer) if you wish to help procuring them.  Now the 67 records appraised are in the middle of getting fully-specialty-tagged (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#specialty-tagging) as part of their Zheln appraisal process. Also, I’m using these tagging sessions to calculate the time required to fully-specialty-tag a record (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/30#issuecomment-706717187).Lieutenant General Status  From an administrative standpoint, Zheln is in constant jeopardy, to be honest, with funds and human resources critically lacking.  It has become very clear now that with my solitary involvement, the Zheln’s mission (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#zhelns-mission) is unattainable.  Therefore, I need to raise resources.  Per my latest calculations (see the pre-latest (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/5aca665eb3f5f0a7c63a186480f6efed40bacebb)), nine full-time jobs will be required, at the very least: three full-time primary appraisers (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#staged-record-appraisal), five full-time specialty-taggers (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#specialty-tagging), and at least one half-full-appraiser/half-website-maintainer.  With a wage of $15 per hour, that I consider a minimum pay, and a maximum 48-hour working week, this will amount to the required crowdfunding of $25,920 per month, which is quite a figure! 🥵  Therefore, I’m resorting to writing a full-scale nonprofit business plan to carefully think things over—The Zheln Manual (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36).  In the light of the considerations above, the academic protocol for Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) is still pending; it will now go along with the Manual (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36).  I believe I can make it in the forthcoming two weeks; afterwards, I’ll finally be able to register Zheln with PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/).  Track the administrative progress in a separate Zheln kanban created specifically for the Full-Scale Launch (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4). 🚀😎  Also, I have created a separate project to collect ideas on how to improve Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/5), but that’s for later. 😉See You Around, Peer Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Sat, Oct 17 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/21)Email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov)Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding OnlyRunning Zheln takes most of my work capacity.

URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/10/2/.Status Anginosus  The protocol (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) is still in the works. I’d very much like to finalize and submit it to PROSPERO by Mon, Oct 12. You can track the progress (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2).  Zheln is getting ready (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/34) to participate in Hacktoberfest (https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)! I’ve incidentally learned about this event on Twitter. This gives a chance to see how crowdsourcing appraisals (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#bonus) could actually look like. Zheln will enrol shortly in line with the protocol write-up.  I’ve conducted no new appraisals since the last summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/07/1/). Once I’m done with the protocol, I’m taking up this issue very seriously to set a stable appraisal schedule.See You Around, Peer Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Wed, Oct 14 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/20)Email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov)Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding OnlyRunning Zheln takes most of my work capacity.

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription (https://patreon.com/zheln) on Patreon. Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Highlights      Record appraisals have sped up; however, this is still too much for me alone    I’m working on it: appraising in a random order; inviting collaborators (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#bonus) and crowdfunders (#help-crowdfund-zheln)    Ultimately, the body of appraisals on Zheln is growing    The academic protocol-writing for Zheln has taken one more week  General Status  In the previous summary, I reported a way to speed up Zheln appraisals (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/03/2/) so that one appraisal took two minutes instead of ten.  I have taken more measurements (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/101f0cdef7eb63ba96fb897273a9adb05defdd7e), and, based on 14 random appraisals, approx. two minutes per appraisal is a solid estimate.  However, I’ve conducted just twenty-one (fourteen (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/101f0cdef7eb63ba96fb897273a9adb05defdd7e) plus seven (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/347cba6b707c8f281cf8483f1286e53a64b38a59)) new appraisals in the last four days since the last summary, of which no appraisal was complete.  This is suggestive of an important consideration: I’m able to appraise only a fraction of incoming records given my current resources. On the one hand, my appraisal speed is not high enough. From the other hand, in fact, I appraise even fewer records than that because of the other activities interfering.  And this is exciting news, to be honest! It implies evidence Zheln cannot be run alone to fully bring its mission (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#zhelns-mission) to life, so in the future more appraisers will be needed.  For now I will have to go with what we’ve got. I appraise records in an automated true random sequence (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/4478989490b9b03ea5235f4e9a420bdc590dc465) now, so this record fraction I appraise is not going to be significantly different from the whole record set.  Anyway, if you know anyone who’s interested in joining the Zheln team, see the opportunity to conduct own appraisals (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#bonus) I wrote about previously!  Also, there’s a fine addition to my collection of systematic reviews awaiting a full appraisal! Currently as a protocol, it aims to assess the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for improving public health (https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/02/345/). Tip: You can locate 10 latest records selected for full appraisal typing appraisal in progress in the Zheln search bar (/search/).Academic Status  Previously, I announced the preparation of the Zheln protocol was in progress (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/03/2/#academic-status) and planned to submit it to PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) by Mon, Oct 5.  However, it takes considerably more effort than I previously thought, so I anticipate the protocol-writing to take several more days. There’s now an understanding of how the writing process is going to look like (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/82d1ea3c55b1087e143114713ec8d4ba894f880b).  It would be great if I finalized the protocol by the next summary on Sat, Oct 10 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/19).

Highlights      It appears I found a way to speed up record appraisals    Appraising one record takes two minutes instead of ten now    I’m writing &amp; submitting the protocol for Zheln to PROSPERO this weekend    Zheln runs out of funds by the end of 2020, but not unless you help crowdfund it (#help-crowdfund-zheln)!  General Status  For a week now that Zheln is fully-armed and operational (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/), I’ve been busy appraising records.  In the previous summaries, quality over quantity (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#why-so-few) was emphasized and the first appraisals (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals) were reported.  In the last three days, I’ve managed to conduct nine appraisals (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/704cd2a6f257930d534dd1e1426a6ab5798fd1fd) only (none complete).  For the record, this is the exact same number of appraisals I conducted earlier (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#how-are-the-appraisals-going).  However, this time it took around two minutes per record instead of the estimated ten minutes per record or five times faster.  However, these measurements are very preliminary, and more research in this direction is coming. I’ve already set up this super Thyme (https://joaomoreno.github.io/thyme/) app by João Moreno (https://github.com/joaomoreno). 😏  But how did I get this far?  On the one hand, I’ve reformatted the editable version of a record (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/8ca4b14a8bb0a394f4ed5565945b31843439104f) to boost its usability.  From the other hand, I’ve reduced the number of specialty tags to one (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/a1f14118677038b80c1afb38b0fcf1f76f87fe5a) during initial appraisal. Then, to add more specialty tags to these records, I will conduct Specialty Tagging Sessions twice a week.  See how it all works out in the next summary post on Wed, Oct 7 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/17)!Academic Status  At first, I did not consider writing up an academic Zheln publication (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#academic-status) a high priority.  But then, I realized the delay in publication of the Zheln protocol actually tampered with both full appraisals (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals) and public relations (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/3).  Therefore, I sped up (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) the Zheln protocol development and endeavor (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/16) to submit it to PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) by Oct 5, 2020, to allow five business days (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#guidancenotes) for its processing.

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription (https://patreon.com/zheln) on Patreon. Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Highlights      The appraisals are going slow, but they are going    Browsing and searching Zheln for appraisals is already worth checking out    How effective behavioral weight-loss interventions in diabetes are?    What is the risk of congenital malformations associated with beta-blocker use?    These are appraisals in progress; meanwhile, please help me crowdfund Zheln (#help-crowdfund-zheln)!  How Are the Appraisals Going?  I still fall short of the expected mark of 570 appraisals per day (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/8#issuecomment-697119605).  As an example, I downloaded 447 &amp; 67 records since the last summary for Sep 26 &amp; Sep 27, respectively.  Sep 28 records are unavailable since PubMed indexing failed (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/bd54ccb3bcd5904bebe13c6c4edc185e88bcf0e5) on this date, and Sep 29 records are unavailable yet because I’m waiting until the day is over in the IDLW time zone (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/f2350f70ad3f2f6ceb3d060d17a4035ef2777f7d).  So of these records, I’ve only appraised nine (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/24).  Clearly, this is a very large mismatch.  I’m not entirely sure how I’m going to deal with it yet, but I’m already checking some steps, like appraising records in a random order (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/f6268a12b1f3258f8bd4fdef3427abaeca0c708a) or documenting the record debt (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/6f916cb5aaf7515ce79b045a68f262960f4a060c); so I’m certain, eventually, I will find a way.Appraisals by Subject  The topic landscape is quite large with 90+ specialty tags already used (/browse/) in at least one appraisal.  The most popular specialty is, predictably, Family Medicine (/family-medicine/) / General Practice (/general-practice/) that already contains seven records despite the current very low appraisal rate.  Most of the systematic reviews I’ve appraised seem too narrow to me to embark autonomously on their appraisal.  Therefore, these appraisals are put on hold until anyone shows interest in and crowdfunds them. Please choose any specialty (/browse/) or use the appraisal search (/search/) if you want a look at these.  Also, it is still quite difficult to choose among specialty tags, but I have polished these methods along the way (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#specialty-tagging).Featured Appraisals  A few systematic reviews seem important enough and are likely to have a great practice impact.  If I face one, I select it for full appraisal on my own initiative.  I’ve got two such systematic reviews by now:  How effective behavioral weight-loss interventions in diabetes (/record/2020/09/02/1/) are?  What is the risk of congenital malformations associated with beta-blocker use in early pregnancy (/record/2020/09/27/6/)?  Both of these, as I see it, are relatable to very large patient populations and, consequently, represent important public health concerns warranting wide awareness.  You can expect completion of these appraisals no earlier than I’ve established stable record triage (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#whats-next).  In any case, I’m not to start full appraisals until I’ve registered Zheln with PROSPERO (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#academic-status).In the MeantimePlease follow progress summaries here on Zheln (https://zheln.com), or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov) twice a week!There was a delay once (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/), but I’ve fixed this since (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/10). 🙂 Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Sat, Oct 3 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/14) Email Me (mailto:pavel@zheln.com)Help Crowdfund ZhelnZheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only Subscribe on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln) for $1–10/mo PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) Donations Also Accepted Search for Appraisals (https://zheln.com/search),  Browse by AMA Specialty (https://zheln.com/browse), or  Read Biweekly Appraisal Summaries (https://zheln.com)"

            "content"    : "Zhelnov P. Thirty hours of screening. Zheln. 2020 Sep 27;39(2):s2e3. URI: https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/.  Highlights      Three records were processed in 30 hours instead of 1,140 planned    Nevertheless, I argue it’s normal as technology &amp; methods are not production-ready    The next week’s focus will be preserving quality while smoothly increasing quantity    Bonus: Everyone can engage in Zheln appraisals from now on!  So What’s New?  In the previous summary (https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/), I came to the conclusion all is ready for record screening and envisaged to process 570 records per day (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/8#issuecomment-697119605).  It is easy to calculate I should’ve processed 1,140 records in these two days that passed since the previous summary.  So how many records have I screened in these 30 hours?  Well, just three records, actually (one (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/02/3/), two (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/02/4/), three (https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/02/5/)).Why So Few?  Personally, it feels quite natural.  First of all, when I set off appraising records, it quickly became evident the editable versions were deficient: I needed to change the record footers manually.  Also, manual selection of the record appraisal status (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/eef4e65ee88a1c9ae9544152014481c46801da3c) turned out to be duplicate.  So I needed to fix the record-maker script (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/general-makeposti.sh) first.  After I’ve fixed the script (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/compare/626337b1862022e03515a3bfc22adce73071bbab..edb49911da27a6f822dec8cadc9ff5763526511f#diff-d556e85617be04293b0ad953ad7028b3), the next thing I noticed was that the specialty tagging methodology (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#specialty-tagging) didn’t feel transparent enough; so I needed to elaborate on these methods (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/compare/06dc0e66ab82b80138011b7afb7e7d4addf3fcb4..eef4e65ee88a1c9ae9544152014481c46801da3c#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8) first.  Indeed, it goes without saying that all the above-mentioned changes necessitated corresponding website modifications, … and so on.      Overall, it feels like the principal reason why, in almost a month of the Zheln’s uptime, just five records entered appraisal and none finished it is as follows:          Zheln’s methods and technology are still not production-ready after a month of development, which is perfectly normal for a systematic review such as this one, especially given that it’s massive, conducted by a single researcher, and crowdfunded only.        ‘Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind.’  Forcing production now would amount to suicide.What’s Next?  Anyway, speeding up is also critical for Zheln.  Honestly, with 500 records added to the queue daily, anything less than a conveyor belt will fail.  So the target of 570 appraisals per day remains, whereas the next week’s focus will be preserving quality while also smoothly increasing quantity.  As the record debt starts to go down, I will adjust this target accordingly to account for the records missed during the current high-intensity but low-volume period.  As to the other directions of Zheln development, namely increasing appraisal completion and preparing an academic manuscript (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2), they will happily wait until proper record processing is settled.Bonus  As one of the most recent updates, I started sharing editable versions of Zheln records (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query/zheln/posts-edit).  Why is it so exciting? 😊  Using these files, other people could engage in record appraisal on Zheln! That means commenting on, replicating, or editing the appraisals.  To do any of that, you’d need to create a GitHub account (https://github.com/join) first. Immediately afterwards, you’ll be able to fork (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) a copy of the Zheln Methods repository (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query) into your own account.  There, choose an editable record you’d like to contribute to among those you forked and edit it (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).  Finally, create (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) a pull request (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your proposed changes. Just after you’ve done it, publicly discussing your pull request in the comments (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request) will be possible.  On GitHub, many really exciting things to do with the records are available (like comparing various versions character-by-character, and many more (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github)).  This is not the simplest solution to collaboration, I admit it. But whatever it is, it works. I hope more collaboration is coming to us in the future of Zheln.See You Around, Peer Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Wed, Sep 30 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/12)Email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov) Search for Appraisals (https://zheln.com/search),  Browse by AMA Specialty (https://zheln.com/browse), or  Read Biweekly Appraisal Summaries (https://zheln.com)"

Highlights      This summary was delayed, but now I have a prevention system in place    From a technical standpoint, Zheln is fully armed and operational    Full-scale record appraisals are ready to deploy at long last    A protocol to register Zheln with PROSPERO is in the works    Help crowdfund an Open Access feature article in BMC Syst Rev!  Oh, I Am Sorry, Frodo  In the previous summary (/summary/2020/09/20/1), I announced this summary to come out on Sep 23.  However, it’s Sep 25 now that it’s actually coming out.  Personally, I find it a zero-tolerance event and apologize to you for it; here’s what I’m going to do to prevent summary delays in future.  I made a separate In progress – High priority column in the GitHub kanban of the Streamline Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/1) project. From now on, all summary publication issues will go there.  Essentially, that means I work on the summaries first thing, writing about what’s done to this point and resisting the temptation to outperform myself at the last moment.  It is worth noting the next summary publication milestone (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/10) was set on Sep 27; that is, I will publish the next summary tomorrow by the end of the day (EDT).  I have great plans for today and tomorrow (see below), so the tomorrow’s summary should not feel worn.  So anyway, please get back for updates this Sunday! 😃General Status  I spent most of the last five days since the previous summary getting the website and appraisal tools ready for work (see the full diff (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/compare/01a547ad0af294a1e8cc2bdd540a22e3c68f64b7..8ac41506fd1b4008981777f78807f355134e18fb) for more info).  And effectively, I’ve succeeded in it.  As of now, Zheln is a fully armed and operational battle station with the website working correctly and General Makeposti, a tailored tool to appraise records, at hand.  Overall, this means I can, at long last, go on with the very record appraisals.Started Appraisals  As to how many records are stuck awaiting appraisal, this is a tough problem.  In fact, I have appraised just 2 out of 5,609 records by now.  Moreover, there is about the same number of records awaiting download from PubMed (estimated [ 5,609 ÷ 12 ] × 11 ≈ 5,148 records); these are the records that appeared in the Replicated Systematic Review Subset (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#pubmed-search) Sep 14 thru Sep 24.  Therefore, I need to start appraising these records ASAP, while also doing concurrent up-to-date appraisals.  For this purpose, I devised a plan to keep up with appraisals (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/8#issuecomment-697119605).  It would allow me to close the 10k-record debt in two months while appraising 22% more records daily.  See how it all works out in the next summary post this Sunday!Completed Appraisals  No appraisals have been fully completed by now.  This is a problem I’m going to solve after I’ve established a stable flow of started appraisals.  Effectively, by the moment a record is moved at least one status level up from awaiting appraisal, it has likely also been specialty tagged, which already means its successful exposition at the target specialty pages.  Therefore, expediting completed appraisals is currently a natural lower priority than streamlining started appraisals.  Also, withholding processing of full texts (i.e. stopping appraisal at the Zheln Step 3 (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#the-ten-steps)) is preferable while registration of Zheln as a research project is pending (see below).Academic Status  One last thing I did since the previous summary was elaborating on the Zheln methods (https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/compare/521d92e419341fe44d0ce5e3227828373a8eef89..a887d7a806eb89c497343fb33b847e5732c2c58b#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8).  This is a very preliminary account; however, a more detailed account is also in the plans as I’ve decided to register Zheln (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) with PROSPERO (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/), a prospective registry of systematic reviews! Zheln’s designed as a living systematic review; thus, it requires prospective registration.  After inspecting the PROSPERO registration guidance (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#guidancenotes), I did not find any issues that would preclude registration of Zheln, albeit a great protocol would be required.  I also considered publishing the protocol in a peer-reviewed journal when ready.  However, as I want it to be an Open Access publication, preferably in BMC Syst Rev, who charge $2,170 per article, I’d better wait until this is fully crowdfunded and then publish a feature article. Please help me crowdfund it (#zheln-is-supported-by-crowdfunding-only)!  In the meantime, I’m going with free-of-charge options such as writing and submitting the protocol to PROSPERO and publishing Zheln on OSF (already done) (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EJKFC).  I have not set any milestones here yet but will do that as soon as I’ve got records processed at a steady pace; this is clearly a lower-priority endeavor.Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only Subscribe on Patreon (https://patreon.com/zheln) for $1–10/mo! Subscription Levels Based on Star Wars Customizable Appraisal Icons (https://patreon.com/zheln) PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) Donations Also AcceptedSee You Around, Peer Get in Touch Now (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or Get Back on Sun, Sep 27 (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/10)Email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com), Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov) Search for Appraisals (https://zheln.com/search),  Browse by AMA Specialty (https://zheln.com/browse), or  Read Biweekly Appraisal Summaries (https://zheln.com)"

I have launched this project in the hopes of bringing evidence closer to practice—the clinical practice, in the first place, but also to other activities associated with intervention into a human life, such as education, business, or policy.Currently (https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13301) and for more than 10 years now (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000326), a wide gap has been recognized between the fast pace research is published and the limited capacity of evidence-based practitioners to promptly process it while also separating the practice-changing wheat from the chaff (https://doi.org/10.1186/s13613-020-00688-2). And to my utmost disappointment, it is in contrast to a variety of solutions available (https://doi.org/10.1111/hir.12318) that the call for a dramatic change is out in 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.01.024).Well, anyway, here I bring a change:  Every systematic review daily added to PubMed will get a rigorous, independent, and open-access critical appraisal.This is the Zheln’s Mission.This is the way. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7Twd85m2g) How Is Zheln Different?The idea of preappraised evidence summaries is all but new (https://doi.org/10.1136/ebm.11.6.162-a). Anyone in the field of evidence-based medicine is well aware of the ACP Journal Club (https://www.acpjournals.org/topic/category/journal-club), Cochrane Clinical Answers (https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cca), or now legacy DARE (https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=32004000332&amp;ID=32004000332) summaries, just to mention a few (https://doi.org/10.7324/JAPS.2020.10717). Not all of them cover secondary research only as Zheln does.Anyway, I never found a resource that would have the following features at the same time (but if you did, I invite you to publicly discuss it on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov)):  Exhaustive research coverage  Rigorous conduct appraisals with replication attempts  Independence proven by full process transparency  Full Open Access  Easy to useThen, in the Summer 2019, I felt like the launch of another was warranted; however, one more year was needed for me to get free of institutional agendas and set a course for this undertaking.So What Does Zheln Offer?Exhaustive Research CoverageNearly All Systematic Reviews Indexed by PubMedRigorous Conduct Appraisals with Replication AttemptsZheln Review Appraisal in 10 Steps:Step 1.

Namely, I’m developing a system to quickly process records in the Zheln format. Currently, development of the Zheln website was a priority, so the appraisals themselves got somewhat overdue. Follow the progress on the public Zheln kanban (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/1)!Step 3. Collect Full Text or Other Review Reports for the RecordStep 4. Full Appraisal: Does Generate Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?One appraisal (https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/3) has been started by now. I will complete it as soon as I have a good record triage system in place, because 5k+ records awaiting appraisal need to be processed ASAP.Step 5. Full Appraisal: Is Duplicate?Step 6.

Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise hundreds of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.  If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription (https://patreon.com/zheln) on Patreon. Afterwards, you’ll be able to immediately PM me with the review request. Otherwise, you might as well send me a donation via PayPal (https://paypal.me/pjelnov) with this reference in the message, and I’ll happily appraise it for you.  Sure thing, the decision to support Zheln is entirely yours to make. You can always reach out to me directly by email (mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on Twitter (https://twitter.com/drzhelnov), Facebook (https://facebook.com/drzhelnov), Instagram (https://instagram.com/igzheln), or Telegram (https://t.me/drzhelnov), and I’ll do my best to help you regardless of your donations.  Thank you for being on the project! That really matters."

Why, let’s have a look at that one first to figure the background. However, there, several other reviews are cited, so we’ll have to look at these first. But within these, some other reviews, too, are referenced. Thus, to keep things nice &amp; clear, let’s build up a chronology.
