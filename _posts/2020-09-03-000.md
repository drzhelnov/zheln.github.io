> 1: Kendrick D, Kai J, Griffiths F, Maula A. Evidence generated from a realistsynthesis of trials on educational weight loss interventions in type 2 diabetesmellitus. Diabet Med. 2020 Sep 1. doi: 10.1111/dme.14394. Epub ahead of print.PMID: 32871624.

So this is a realist synthesis, not an interventional review; but as authors claim, they have already conducted an interventional review as a separate undertaking. There’s the reference:

Maula A, Kai J, Woolley AK, Weng S, Dhalwani N, Griffiths FE, Khunti K,
Kendrick D. Educational weight loss interventions in obese and overweight adults with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Diabet Med. 2020 Apr;37(4):623-635. doi: 10.1111/dme.14193. Epub 2019 Dec 22. PMID: 31785118; PMCID: PMC7154644.

Why, let’s have a look at that one first.
