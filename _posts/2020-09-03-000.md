So this is a realist synthesis, not an interventional review; but as authors claim, they have already conducted an [interventional review][Maula2020623635] as a separate undertaking. Why, letâ€™s have a look at that one first to figure the background. However, there, several other reviews are cited, so weâ€™ll have to look at these first. But within these, some other reviews, too, are referenced. Thus, to keep things nice & clear, letâ€™s build up a chronology.
