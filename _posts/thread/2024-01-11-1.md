## How can doctors know which cancer treatment is better?

#### The Facts:

<!---
Zheln: Summarize this in engaging plain language:

- A 200-page research report was [published][wade_ablative_2023] in December 2023 that explored evidence on novel treatments of early-stage liver cancer, otherwise known as hepatocellular carcinoma. With respect to this particular cancer, early-stage means the size of the neoplasm less than 3 cm and no distant tumor growth. - Using advanced statistical techniques, invented just 5 to 20 years ago, the researchers compared multiple treatments, including high-energy destruction, irradiation, chemo, and surgery. Additionally, they were able to account for the quality of scientific data by forecasting the impact that it may have on the numbers. - The scientists ranked treatment techniques by their efficacy and calculated the amount of numerical change needed to “overthrow” the top-performing procedure in the “league table.” Two groups of metrics were used to assess efficacy: patient survival (overall and progression-free) and tumor recurrence (overall and local). - This evidence suggested unusual conclusions that contradict clinical judgement or tumor biology; the most radical treatment, liver surgery, commonly thought to be the most effective treatment due to the full removal of the neoplasm, performed worse than more “dirty” techniques such as high-energy destruction (ablation), sometimes combined with irradiation or chemo. - This evidence illustrates the state-of-the-art scientific techniques employed for picking the best treatment from a range of possible options.

Claude: Here is a 147-word plain language summary of the key points from the research report:

A major medical study published last month overturned common assumptions about the best way to treat early-stage liver cancer. Researchers compared multiple treatments, including surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy, and a newer technique called high-energy destruction or ablation. Using cutting-edge statistical methods, they ranked treatments based on patient survival rates and cancer recurrence levels. 

Surprisingly, the study found that completely removing tumors through surgery - long seen as the gold standard - was less effective than less radical options like ablation, sometimes combined with irradiation or chemo. The full surgical removal of tumors is commonly thought to be the most successful approach.  

However, the advanced number-crunching techniques used in this study accounted for the quality of data from different treatments and still found ablation outperformed surgery. This shows how the latest scientific methods can challenge clinical assumptions and help identify better options among various possible treatments. The study demonstrates a state-of-the-art approach for determining optimal medical therapies.

A major medical study [published][wade_ablative_2023] in December 2023 challenged a common assumption about the best way to treat cancer. Researchers compared multiple treatments of early-stage liver cancer, including surgery, irradiation, chemotherapy, and a newer technique called high-energy destruction or ablation. Using cutting-edge statistical methods, they ranked treatments based on patient survival rates and cancer recurrence levels, accounting for statistical variation and study quality. 

Surprisingly, the study found that completely removing tumors through surgery – long seen as the gold standard – could be equally effective in improving survival and reducing tumor recurrence as less radical options like ablation, sometimes combined with irradiation or chemo, while still leading to more adverse events, including postoperative complications, major complications, and serious pain requiring painkillers. You’ll be able to see this for yourself shortly.

Let’s look at the figure above, which is also called a “forest plot” thanks to a tree crown resemblance. We’ll use a more practical metaphor: Imagine that each black horizontal line in the image is a track runner, representing a cancer treatment, and the vertical dashed line is the finish line. The blue dot is the runner’s head (the estimated effect from the trials; in this case, overall survival), and the line is the span of the runner’s step (the probability range of the effect estimate). Our runners are moving from the right to the left, striving to cross the finish line; whichever treatment line is fully beyond the vertical line, the treatment is considered to outperform the gold standard therapy – which, as per the raw results of the trials, is radiofrequency ablation. Can you now see which treatment performed better?

Now imagine what – our runners are fake; they are actually riding slimes, represented by light-blue bands (which show the extended probability range that also takes trial quality into account). So, they need the slime to drag their entire slimey body beyond the finish line before the rider can complete the race. Spoiler alert: the winner is the 6th slime from the top, representing radiofrequency ablation combined with the implantation of radioactive iodine-125 into the tumor.

Alas, look at the 4th band from the top! That rider suddenly got off the slime and went about their business. Who knows what the folk is up to? It’s clearly against the rules. So, this one is disqualified. Metaphorically speaking, this 4th line, microwave ablation, has a chance of competing with the top-choice procedure, radiofrequency ablation plus radioactive substance, if more high-quality trials show its effectiveness.

Incidentally, the traditional hardcore surgery (liver resection) is the 3rd line from the top – can you now tell how well it performed versus radiofrequency ablation? This example shows how the latest scientific methods can challenge clinical assumptions and help pick better options among various possible treatments based on the bulk evidence from human trials.

#### The Evidence:

- An over-200-page research report was [published][wade_ablative_2023] in December 2023 that explored evidence on novel treatments of early-stage liver cancer, otherwise known as hepatocellular carcinoma. With respect to this particular cancer, early-stage means the size of the neoplasm less than 3 cm and no distant tumor growth.
- Using advanced statistical techniques, developed over the last 25 years (called network meta-analysis), the researchers compared multiple treatments, including high-energy destruction (ablation, laser), irradiation, chemo, surgery (liver resection), ethanol and acid injections, and other dangerous stuff. Additionally, they were able to account for the quality of scientific data by forecasting the impact that it may have on the numbers (using a technique called threshold analysis).
- The scientists ranked treatment procedures by their efficacy and calculated the amount of numerical change needed to “overthrow” the top-performing procedure in the “league table.” Two groups of metrics were used to assess efficacy: patient survival (overall and progression-free) and tumor recurrence (overall and local).
- The evidence suggested unusual conclusions that contradict clinical judgment or common-sense tumor biology; the most radical treatment, liver surgery, commonly thought to be the most effective treatment due to the full removal of the neoplasm, performed no better than more “dirty” techniques such as radiofrequency ablation. This conclusion stood even when study quality and statistical variation were taken into account.
- Additionally, the implantation of radioactive iodine-125 (brachytherapy) boosted the effect of radiofrequency ablation, based on overall survival, and was forecasted to improve overall tumor recurrence rates in future trials. Microwave ablation is a promising competitor of radiofrequency ablation and could outperform it by overall survival and local disease recurrence in future trials.
- This evidence illustrates the state-of-the-art scientific techniques employed for picking the best treatment from a range of possible options, as well as selecting the most promising candidates for future studies.
