## Anticholinergic Deprescribing and Cognitive Decline Risk

This Cochrane systematic review summarized the evidence from 3 randomized controlled trials (total 299 participants) investigating whether interventions to reduce anticholinergic medication burden can improve cognitive outcomes in older adults. 

The trials included a mix of cognitively healthy older adults and those with some cognitive impairment at baseline. The interventions aimed to reduce anticholinergic burden through medication changes. Outcomes were measured at 1-3 months after the interventions.

The review authors rated the certainty of evidence as very low overall. Two trials successfully reduced anticholinergic burden but had inconsistent effects on various cognitive tests:
- One trial found improved scores on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test but no difference in proportion with reduced burden.  
- Another found no difference on multiple cognitive measures but a correlation between reduced burden and better working memory.

No trials found significant improvements in other clinical outcomes like mortality, quality of life, function, etc. No data on safety of interventions. 

The authors concluded there is insufficient evidence to determine if reducing anticholinergic medications preserves or improves cognition in older adults. Larger, longer-term RCTs are needed, separately evaluating cognitively healthy and impaired populations.

## Effects of Early Education on School Readiness

Here is a summary of the key methods and findings from this review:

Methods:
- Systematic review with meta-analysis of 32 studies involving 16,899 children aged 3-7 years. 
- 4 studies compared center-based early education interventions to no treatment; 22 studies compared an enriched curriculum to standard treatment.
- Studies conducted around the world, mostly in the USA, lasting on average 12 months (longest 6 years).

Findings:
- The center-based interventions may have little to no effect on overall school readiness, but there is very low to moderate certainty in the evidence. 
- Reasons for uncertainty include: possible bias from lack of blinding, variability in interventions, limited data reported on broader measures of school readiness, and relatively few studies overall.
- Specific outcomes had similarly mixed findings with very low, low, or moderate certainty ratings.

In summary, while there may be some benefits of center-based early education programs for improving school readiness, the current evidence is too uncertain to draw firm conclusions. More high-quality studies focusing on standardized measures of school readiness are needed.
