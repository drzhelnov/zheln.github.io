## Anticholinergic Deprescribing and Cognitive Decline Risk

Older adults commonly take multiple drugs at once. Many of them impact a person‚Äôs cognition, as is seen, for example, in a commonly [misused][dourron_qualitative_2023] over-the-counter drug against allergies, diphenhydramine. The combined impact of such medications (that are called anticholinergic) can increase the risk of dementia and lead to other poor health outcomes. An online calculator, which was created to estimate this combined impact, features a [list](https://www.acbcalc.com/medicines) of over 170 drugs that possess these properties. Accordingly, current guidelines for health care practitioners include the [recommendation](https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng97/chapter/Recommendations#medicines-that-may-cause-cognitive-impairment) to try and reduce this burden when prescribing to older adults. In consequence, this topic is massively important and impacts [over 500 million](https://www.un.org/en/global-issues/ageing) older people worldwide.

Little is known about the barriers and facilitators to successfully reducing this burden. A [2021 study][stewart_barriers_2021] identified two studies that asked a total of 48 health care practitioners about this, and they spoke about many barriers. Importantly, but not unusually, unfortunately, no studies were identified that actually asked the patients or their carers about this problem, how they feel about it, or how they think it could be changed.

Eventually, a [new study][taylor-rowan_anticholinergic_2023] published in the past week reviewed the effectiveness of any measures aimed at the reduction of this kind of drug burden. Only three trials were identified, and all of them looked at medication review and changes by health care teams. However, the data reported were so poor that the researchers could draw no conclusions from it, despite the involvement of a total of almost 300 participants in these trials.

In summary, anticholinergic burden is a widely recognized medical problem. Despite that, no evidence is available as to the successes of anticholinergic burden reduction. 300 participants were involved in 3 trials to test that, but the trials did not provide good evidence. No studies have looked at how patients feel about the anticholinergic drug burden.
