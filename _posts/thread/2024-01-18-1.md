## Anti-flu drug failed to show dramatic effects in clinical trials.

### Screw the evidence. Let’s hear an inside story:

#### The Facts:

Tamiflu, an anti-flu medication, reduces the duration of illness by about half a day on average and prevents a few cases of flu from happening. These pieces of evidence come from a [major 2014 study][jefferson_neuraminidase_2014], and they are mirrored pretty accurately in two of Google’s top hits for [Tamiflu](https://www.google.com/search?q=tamiflu), consumer webpages by the [U.S. Food & Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tamiflu-consumer-questions-and-answers) (FDA) and the [European Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu) (EMA). Tamiflu has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations, but the agencies are not trying to make it look like it did, and it’s not the point we are trying to make today anyway. For once, I don’t want to prove anything to you, just tell an inside story, coming from a [2023 study][hanula_evaluation_2024], a story nobody likely ever told you.

Once upon a time, a group of over 2,800 people got flu. These were rather healthy females and males, 45 years old on average, and they did not have many chronic health problems. 9 out of 10 identified as either White or Asian. So, the flu test was positive, but folks were not sick enough to need hospital care, so they visited a health care provider and, eventually, got enrolled in a clinical trial. Strangely enough, the trialists could have given them an innovative anti-flu drug, Tamiflu, but they just provided routine care. Many of them were also given a sham pill, placebo, that looked much like Tamiflu. Then they were followed up, and about 25 of them got sick enough to need hospital treatment. Some folks got lost to follow up, but not many. That’s the story, but not the entire story.

At the same time, there was another group of people, about 3,300 of them, who also got flu. By almost any parameter, they averaged the same as the previous one: in their forties, mostly White, and with few chronic illnesses. Even if we wanted to compare their income levels, for example, or their kids’ school marks, we would likely be surprised to see how these numbers would also have been similar. That’s because in reality, there were about 6,100 people, and they were assigned into those groups randomly, like in a lottery. So, the people in this group were given Tamiflu, an anti-flu treatment. Remember that about 25 people from the untreated group got hospitalized. What number would you expect in this one?

Well, if it’s an anti-flu drug that’s as good as advertised in a <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [TV commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwgyumJy5Ak), or judging by its <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [cellular antiviral mechanisms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LSP02MkNOU), the number of hospitalizations should drop at least twofold, from 25 to 12 or something. Or, even better, right? Right..?

After running the analyses, the number of hospitalizations among those who took Tamiflu was no different from those who received standard therapy and/or placebo. Adjusting for statistics, we can tell that should those 2,800 people from the untreated group have taken the active pill, somewhere near 15 to 35 people would have been hospitalized.

Now, that’s the entire story. And that’s the evidence – just some numbers with a pinch of scientific scrutiny over it. You are free to interpret it the way you see fit. At the same time, it is as scientific as iPhones, X-rays, or antibiotics, but less visible and tangible, like astronomy. Science is like a board game with its rules modeled after reality – you just learn some lore, and you are good to go. This is even more true for a person with the disease, like someone with flu, in whose best interest all of the health care is being (or should be) done and who is as important a decision-maker as all the health pros.

#### The Evidence:

<!---
Zheln: summarize the below in bullet points:

Claude 2 AI:  Here are the key points summarized in bullet points:

- A major 2014 study found that Tamiflu reduces flu illness duration by about half a day on average and prevents some flu cases from happening. This aligns with info from the FDA and European Medicines Agency.

- Tamiflu has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations from the flu.

- A 2023 study of over 6,100 people with the flu found no difference in hospitalizations between those given Tamiflu vs those given placebo or standard therapy.

- The study participants were relatively healthy - in their 40s on average, mostly White or Asian, with few chronic illnesses. 

- If Tamiflu worked as well as advertised, the number of hospitalizations should have dropped at least twofold, from 25 to 12 or less. But the actual number was statistically no different.

- The evidence on Tamiflu is just some numbers with scientific scrutiny. Science is like a board game - you learn some lore and you can interpret data.

- People with a disease are important decision makers, not just health professionals. The health care system should serve their best interests.

- A [2014 Cochrane systematic review][jefferson_neuraminidase_2014] found that Tamiflu (oseltamivir) reduces flu illness duration by about half a day on average and prevents some influenza cases from happening. This aligns with info from some of Google’s top hits on [Tamiflu](https://www.google.com/search?q=tamiflu), such as those from the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tamiflu-consumer-questions-and-answers) and [European Medicines Agency](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu).
- In the same study, oseltamivir has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations from flu, pooling the data from 7 randomized trials and 4,400 patients.
- A [2023 systematic review][hanula_evaluation_2024] included 15 randomized trials and over 6,100 patients with flu and found no difference in hospitalizations between those given Tamiflu vs those given placebo and/or standard therapy. The study participants were relatively healthy - in their 40s on average, mostly White or Asian, with few chronic illnesses.
- If Tamiflu worked as well as advertised, the number of hospitalizations should be expected to have dropped dramatically. But the actual number was statistically no different.
- This example shows how scientific evidence is open to interpretation – one just needs to learn some context and draw their own conclusions. Patients themselves are critical decision-makers, so health systems should definitely prioritize making scientific evidence accessible to them.
