## Cranberry Effects on Urinary Tract Infections

Unfortunately, this review did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria to assess the effectiveness of cranberries for treating urinary tract infections. 

The reviewers searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized trials evaluating cranberry juice or cranberry products for the treatment of UTIs. The outcomes of interest were reduction in UTI symptoms, urine sterilization, side effects, and adherence to therapy.

No studies fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Seven studies were excluded due to being the wrong study design, having mixed interventions, or not reporting relevant outcomes. One ongoing study was identified but its current status is unknown.

The authors concluded that currently there is no good quality evidence to suggest cranberries are effective for treating UTIs. Well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with relevant outcomes are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of cranberry products for UTI treatment. Given the lack of eligible studies, this review does not provide summary of findings or certainty of evidence ratings. More research is warranted in this area before conclusions can be made about the role of cranberries for UTI treatment.
