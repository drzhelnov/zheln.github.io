## Cranberry Effects on Urinary Tract Infections

Two major reviews, both updated just recently (November and December), but more reviews out there

[][jepson_cranberries_2023]

[][jepson_cranberries_1998]

The most recent about treatment [][jepson_cranberries_2023] was an update of the review that was published back in 1998 and updated several times since, every time not finding any relevant trials. This time this was no different, so we still have no evidence about cranberry products for _treating_ UTIs. I mean, yes there is evidence, but this comes from low-quality and very low quality studies, all nonrandomized, and from personal accounts. This is not considered good evidence anyway and is very uncertain, and that’s the reputable Cochrane even doesn’t bother looking at such evidence, only focusing on randomized trials.

But there is something to discuss around prevention. [][williams_cranberries_2023] was published just recently, in November 2023, and was a major update of the previous 2012 review [][jepson_cranberries_2012]. The 2012 found as many as 24 randomized trials with a total of over 4,400 participants, and fpund moderate-certainty evidence of _no_ effectiveness.

So I got interested in what internet has to say about this and ran the simplest possible Google search https://www.google.com/search?q=cranberry+utis

Looked at a couple of top hits

Medical News Today

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306498

> How we reviewed this article:
>
> SOURCES
> Medical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and draws only from peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations. We avoid using tertiary references. We link primary sources — including studies, scientific references, and statistics — within each article and also list them in the resources section at the bottom of our articles. You can learn more about how we ensure our content is accurate and current by reading our editorial policy.

But, just referenced one trial http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2015.04.003 and failed to provide context: the 2012 version of the prevention Cochrane review [][jepson_cranberries_2012] was already out there at the moment, and it showed no effectiveness. The trial they are covering suggested otherwise. The trial was accounted for in [][williams_cranberries_2023]. So a major review by the most reputable organization worldwide, covering 24 randomized trials and over 4,400 participants, and finding moderate-certainty evidence of _no_ effectiveness, but Medical News Today just discarded that (or did not make an effort to look up).

HealthEssentials Cleveland Clinic

https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-cranberry-juice-stop-uti

No info about the methodology in the post

So, they are claiming:

> One 2013 analysis of 13 different trials concluded that cranberry juice and tablets did reduce the occurrence of UTIs compared to placebo in women with recurrent UTIs. But another review found that they didn’t.

So, they are referring to https://doi.org/10.1136/eb-2012-100984 which apparently is an intermediary report of the review eventually published as https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2012.3004

OK, no problem, but they are not referencing the 2012 Cochrane review

Also, they refer to “another review” which in fact upon simply clicking the link is a randomized trial report, not a review: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.10.006

Just to let you know, this trial is included in [][williams_cranberries_2023], so we are good to go

What’s more fun, and just to give you a glimpse of the thoroughness of a good systematic review ­­- even the 2012 version [][jepson_cranberries_2012] was aware of that trial despite that its results were published in the same year, 2012. However, they mentioned it but did not have the time to incorporate the findings in the analysis. [][williams_cranberries_2023] did that

So going back to HealthEssentials Cleveland Clinic, after this series of misleading statements, they just asked some doctor who eventually gave some recommendations. Clearly, that’s not how you want to to do health news.

Just to remind, we are still talking only about prevention. Like, I did not specify this in my Google query, but that’s what those two top hit posts referred to. No mentions of treatment so far.

Let’s also see what chatgpt got to say about this. My prompt:

> are cranberries effective against urinary tract infections?

ChatGPT:

> Cranberries have been traditionally thought to be helpful in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The idea is that certain compounds in cranberries may prevent bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli (E. coli), from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, reducing the risk of infection.
>
> The active compounds in cranberries are believed to be proanthocyanidins. These compounds are thought to interfere with the adhesion of bacteria to the urinary tract lining. However, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing or treating UTIs is mixed.
>
> While some studies suggest that cranberry products, such as juice or supplements, may have a modest preventive effect, other research has not consistently supported this claim. It's important to note that cranberry products are not a substitute for medical treatment if you already have a UTI. If you suspect a urinary tract infection, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, typically involving antibiotics.
>
> If you're considering using cranberry products for UTI prevention, it's advisable to speak with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and any existing medical conditions. Additionally, it's crucial to choose products that are low in added sugars, as excessive sugar intake can have negative health implications.

So, that suggestion about “mixed evidence” again. Maybe they work, maybe they don’t. I remind you that starting from 2012 there was a major review published that covered 24 _randomized_ trials and over 4,400 patients, that found _moderate-certainty_ (e.g., it could as well be low or very low, as is true for so many other questions, but not in this instance) of _no_ effectiveness. So to me, that’s pretty something, not “mixed” evidence.

But let’s see what the updated version found. 

---

Unfortunately, this review did not identify any studies that met the inclusion criteria to assess the effectiveness of cranberries for treating urinary tract infections. 

The reviewers searched multiple databases for randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomized trials evaluating cranberry juice or cranberry products for the treatment of UTIs. The outcomes of interest were reduction in UTI symptoms, urine sterilization, side effects, and adherence to therapy.

No studies fulfilled all the inclusion criteria. Seven studies were excluded due to being the wrong study design, having mixed interventions, or not reporting relevant outcomes. One ongoing study was identified but its current status is unknown.

The authors concluded that currently there is no good quality evidence to suggest cranberries are effective for treating UTIs. Well-designed, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with relevant outcomes are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of cranberry products for UTI treatment. Given the lack of eligible studies, this review does not provide summary of findings or certainty of evidence ratings. More research is warranted in this area before conclusions can be made about the role of cranberries for UTI treatment.
