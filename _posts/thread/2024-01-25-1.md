## It is unclear how to improve seat belt use.

### Seat belt promotion was found unsuccessful in over 12,000 participants across 15 trials.

Chat title: Seat Belt Interventions: A Systematic Review of Education, Incentives, and Engineering Approaches

Zheln: Summarize the methods and findings of this study. Always preserve confidence intervals and certainty of evidence ratings. If there is a Summary of Findings table, focus your findings summary on it. Write in coherent text, not bullet points.

Claude 2 AI: This Cochrane systematic review analyzed 15 randomized controlled trials with 12,081 participants that evaluated education, engineering, and incentive-based interventions to promote seat belt use. The studies were conducted primarily in the US and recruited participants from various sites like worksites, schools, emergency departments etc.

The key findings were:

- Behavioral education interventions (e.g. motivational interviews, behavioral counseling) may improve seat belt use in adolescents and adults (low certainty evidence). A health risk appraisal intervention also likely improves seat belt use short-term (moderate certainty evidence).
- Engineering interventions like in-vehicle monitoring systems with alerts/feedback may promote seat belt use but the evidence is from only 2 small trials (low certainty evidence).
- None of the trials reported on crash-related injuries or deaths.

The authors conclude that while there is some evidence that education and engineering interventions may promote seat belt use, more high-quality research is needed particularly from low- and middle-income countries. Limitations include reliance on self-reported seat belt use data in most trials and small sample sizes testing engineering interventions. More research on incentives and other intervention types is also needed.

Zheln: summarize the above in bullet points
Claude 2 AI: Here are the key findings summarized in bullet points:
- 4 trials found behavioral education interventions (motivational interviews, counseling) may improve self-reported seat belt use in adolescents and adults (low certainty evidence).
- 1 trial found a health risk appraisal intervention likely improves observed seat belt use short-term (6 weeks) (moderate certainty evidence).
- 2 trials found in-vehicle monitoring systems with alerts/feedback may promote seat belt use but both had small samples and high baseline use (low certainty evidence).
- None of the 15 trials reported on crash-related injuries or deaths.
- Authors conclude more high-quality research is needed, particularly from low- and middle-income countries.
- Limitations include reliance on self-reported seat belt use data in most trials and small samples testing engineering interventions.
- More research needed on incentives and other intervention types.
