## Seatbelt promotion works. But how well?

### 60% of drivers still don’t use seat belts (and even more passengers).

![World country map of seat-belt law status, 2022. Source: Figure 15 from Global status report on road safety 2023. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2023. Licence: CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 IGO.](/images/{{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}-{{ page.issue }}.{{ page.img_ext }})

_Note: As of January 2024, the map is no longer accurate because, for example, in Mexico, a law was enacted in 2022 that made seat belts [obligatory for all passengers](https://www.reporteindigo.com/reporte/ley-de-movilidad-todos-los-pasajeros-deben-usar-el-cinturon-de-seguridad-en-todo-el-pais/)._

Chat title: Seat Belt Interventions: A Systematic Review of Education, Incentives, and Engineering Approaches

Zheln: Summarize the methods and findings of this study. Always preserve confidence intervals and certainty of evidence ratings. If there is a Summary of Findings table, focus your findings summary on it. Write in coherent text, not bullet points.

Claude 2 AI: This Cochrane systematic review analyzed 15 randomized controlled trials with 12,081 participants that evaluated education, engineering, and incentive-based interventions to promote seat belt use. The studies were conducted primarily in the US and recruited participants from various sites like worksites, schools, emergency departments etc.

The key findings were:

- Behavioral education interventions (e.g. motivational interviews, behavioral counseling) may improve seat belt use in adolescents and adults (low certainty evidence). A health risk appraisal intervention also likely improves seat belt use short-term (moderate certainty evidence).
- Engineering interventions like in-vehicle monitoring systems with alerts/feedback may promote seat belt use but the evidence is from only 2 small trials (low certainty evidence).
- None of the trials reported on crash-related injuries or deaths.

The authors conclude that while there is some evidence that education and engineering interventions may promote seat belt use, more high-quality research is needed particularly from low- and middle-income countries. Limitations include reliance on self-reported seat belt use data in most trials and small sample sizes testing engineering interventions. More research on incentives and other intervention types is also needed.

The idea of the usefulness of seat belts for the prevention of deaths and serious injuries in car accidents seems to be indisputable among public health officials. For example, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [advocate][cdc] the use of seat belts, claiming that they “reduce serious crash-related injuries and deaths by about half” and reportedly “saved almost 15,000 lives in 2017,” based on U.S. data. _[Global status report on road safety 2023][who]_ by the reputable World Health Organization (WHO) warns, “Failure to use seat-belts is a major risk factor for road traffic deaths and injuries among vehicle occupants,” and commends seat-belt mandates, shown in the image above.

If we look up some of the evidence cited, seat belts [were tentatively found][fouda_mbarga_seatbelt_2018] to reduce the risk of overall injuries, but a subgroup analysis by the location of the critical injury gave inconclusive results, meaning that some types of injuries may actually be unprevented by seat belts, such as head, neck, or chest trauma. This does not necessarily mean seat belts don’t work. In fact, seat belts are associated with an [abdominal injury of their own][pourmand_prevalence_2024], even though the risk of overall abdominal injuries decreases, as the aforementioned subgroup analysis suggests. The physics of seat belts in simulated car crashes <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> [make it visual][yt] how they work: by restraining the user, they won’t let them move forward after the car has crashed against a barrier, which hopefully saves lives. A [2011 analysis][abbas_seatbelts_2011] based on WHO’s data from 46 high-income countries showed that seat-belt compliance was strongly associated with road traffic death rates. There is room for speculation about causality here, however, as these are high-level data that do not preclude the existence of a third variable that improves both seat-belt compliance and motor vehicle accident statistics, thus remaining masked in the analysis.

A [recent study][lourens_education_2024] by Cochrane, the world’s leader in synthesizing medical evidence, went unnoticed in the news media ([see our research](#the-research)). This analysis looked at the effectiveness of activities promoting the use of seat belts. The activities studied included various education formats offered in sites such as workplaces, schools, or health care organizations, and a couple of trials investigated in-vehicle data monitoring and alert systems, with the majority of data collection conducted in the US. Cochrane has already published a [useful summary][cochrane] of this study for the general public, which concluded that they “found some evidence to suggest education-based (behavioural and health risk appraisal (HRA)) and engineering-based interventions may promote seat-belt use in early and late adolescents and adults; however, we are not confident in the current evidence.” Zheln [has reviewed](#the-research) their entire scientific report and confirms that this statement is accurate. To elaborate a bit on what exactly Cochrane did in this study, they looked at 15 randomized trials encompassing over 12,000 participants but were unable to combine these data due to their very mixed nature, so they ended up looking at each trial separately. It’s also of note that all 15 trials had a high risk of inflated findings, but that was more of a limitation of the study setting than a failure on the researchers’ part. Importantly, none of the trials reported on crash-related injuries or deaths.

The best takeaway from this complex picture is probably that our understanding of how the seat belt, or rather, seat-belt promotion works in practice is still quite vague. A previous study found [modest but positive][akbari_effectiveness_2021] evidence of the effectiveness of mass media campaigns in increasing the use of seat belts. A US-based analysis [found][shults_primary_2004] a median increase of 33 percentage points in observed seat-belt use after the enactment of seat-belt enforcement laws. With all these measures in place, seat-belt use is still far from universal: its pooled global rate, [as of 2020][kargar_prevalence_2023], was at about 40% for drivers, 35% for front-seat passengers, and 10–15% for rear-seat passengers. We can also clearly see how the evidence in which the effectiveness claims are grounded is predominantly US-based.

#### The Evidence:

Chat title: Seat Belt Use Rates and Evidence in Different Vehicle Seats

Zheln: summarize the above in bullet points

Claude 2 AI:  Here are the key points from the document summarized in bullet points:

- Public health organizations like the CDC and WHO advocate for seat belt use, claiming they reduce crash-related injuries and deaths by about half and saved 15,000 lives in the US in 2017.

- Evidence on seat belt effectiveness is inconclusive for some types of injuries - they may prevent overall injuries but not certain ones like head, neck or chest trauma. 

- Physics shows how seat belts restrain occupants and prevent them from moving forward in a crash.

- Analysis of WHO data associates seat belt compliance with lower traffic death rates across 46 high-income countries, but causality is speculative.  

- A recent Cochrane review found some evidence that education and in-vehicle alerts may promote seat belt use in adolescents and adults, but the evidence is not very confident.

- The Cochrane review looked at 15 small randomized trials but couldn't combine the data due to heterogeneity. None of the trials measured crash-related outcomes.

- Understanding the real-world effectiveness of seat belt promotion is still quite vague. Other analyses find positive impacts of media campaigns and laws on seat belt use.

- Despite promotion efforts, seat belt use rates remain low globally - around 40% for drivers, 35% for front passengers and 10-15% for rear passengers.

- Most evidence on seat belt effectiveness is from the US context.
