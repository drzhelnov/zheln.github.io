## Effects of Early Education on School Readiness

Here is a summary of the key methods and findings from this review:

Methods:
- Systematic review with meta-analysis of 32 studies involving 16,899 children aged 3-7 years. 
- 4 studies compared center-based early education interventions to no treatment; 22 studies compared an enriched curriculum to standard treatment.
- Studies conducted around the world, mostly in the USA, lasting on average 12 months (longest 6 years).

Findings:
- The center-based interventions may have little to no effect on overall school readiness, but there is very low to moderate certainty in the evidence. 
- Reasons for uncertainty include: possible bias from lack of blinding, variability in interventions, limited data reported on broader measures of school readiness, and relatively few studies overall.
- Specific outcomes had similarly mixed findings with very low, low, or moderate certainty ratings.

In summary, while there may be some benefits of center-based early education programs for improving school readiness, the current evidence is too uncertain to draw firm conclusions. More high-quality studies focusing on standardized measures of school readiness are needed.
