## Effects of Beetroot Supplements on Muscular Performance

Here is a summary of the key methods and findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis:

Methods
- Conducted a systematic literature search across 4 databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of beetroot-based supplements (BRS) on muscular endurance and strength in healthy adult males
- 27 studies with 396 participants met eligibility criteria and were included
- Outcomes: Muscular endurance (e.g. reps to failure, time to exhaustion) and muscular strength (e.g. maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), peak torque) 
- Quality assessed using PEDro scale (most studies high or excellent quality)
- Meta-analyses conducted using random effects models

Key Findings
Muscular Endurance:
- Small positive effect of BRS vs placebo overall (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.51, 16 studies, n=208)
- Effect greater with dynamic/isotonic exercise specifically (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.64)
- No differences by training level, muscle group, nitrate dose or supplementation duration

Muscular Strength: 
- Small positive effect of BRS vs placebo overall (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.48, 18 studies, n=287)
- Significant effect only for strength measured in a fatigued state (SMD = 0.64, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.03), not resting state
- No differences by training level, muscle group, exercise type, nitrate dose or supplementation duration

The authors conclude that BRS supplementation has a small but significant positive effect on muscular endurance (especially for isotonic exercise) and attenuates declines in muscular strength measured in a fatigued state in healthy young men.
