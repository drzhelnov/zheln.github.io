## Effects of Beetroot Supplements on Muscular Performance

Initial review [][evangelista_effects_2024] only focusing on muscular strength and endurance and only on health males, which can be too restrictive

Epistemonikos helped find other reviews

So now looking for broader ones that looked at muscular and sports performance, exclusive of hypertension effects, and only those that looked at randomized trials

One of the top hits on Google https://www.google.com/search?q=beetroot+gym did not limit inclusion to randomized trials and did not perform quality and certainty of evidence assessment: https://doi.org/10.3390/nu9010043


A couple of other top hits from Google - very interesting and controversial

Also asked ChatGPT:

> is beetroot good before exercise?

ChatGPT:

> Yes, beetroot can be a beneficial food to consume before exercise. Beetroot is rich in nitrates, which the body can convert into nitric oxide. Nitric oxide helps to relax blood vessels, improve blood flow, and increase oxygen delivery to muscles. This can potentially enhance exercise performance, especially during endurance activities.
>
> Beetroot juice or whole beets are commonly used for this purpose. Some studies suggest that consuming beetroot about 2-3 hours before exercise may be optimal for maximizing the nitric oxide benefits. However, individual responses can vary, so it's a good idea to experiment with timing and amounts to see what works best for you.
>
> It's essential to be aware that beetroot can also have a mild laxative effect in some individuals, so it's a good idea to try it in a controlled manner before a workout to see how your body responds.
>
> Always consider your personal preferences, tolerances, and any potential interactions with other foods or medications you may be taking. If you have specific health concerns or conditions, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional or a nutritionist before making significant changes to your diet.

Here is a summary of the key methods and findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis:

Methods
- Conducted a systematic literature search across 4 databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of beetroot-based supplements (BRS) on muscular endurance and strength in healthy adult males
- 27 studies with 396 participants met eligibility criteria and were included
- Outcomes: Muscular endurance (e.g. reps to failure, time to exhaustion) and muscular strength (e.g. maximal voluntary contraction (MVC), peak torque) 
- Quality assessed using PEDro scale (most studies high or excellent quality)
- Meta-analyses conducted using random effects models

Key Findings
Muscular Endurance:
- Small positive effect of BRS vs placebo overall (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.51, 16 studies, n=208)
- Effect greater with dynamic/isotonic exercise specifically (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.64)
- No differences by training level, muscle group, nitrate dose or supplementation duration

Muscular Strength: 
- Small positive effect of BRS vs placebo overall (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.03 to 0.48, 18 studies, n=287)
- Significant effect only for strength measured in a fatigued state (SMD = 0.64, 95% CI 0.25 to 1.03), not resting state
- No differences by training level, muscle group, exercise type, nitrate dose or supplementation duration

The authors conclude that BRS supplementation has a small but significant positive effect on muscular endurance (especially for isotonic exercise) and attenuates declines in muscular strength measured in a fatigued state in healthy young men.
