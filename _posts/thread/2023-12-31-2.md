## Cranberry Effects on Urinary Tract Infections

I’ll just say in short that a big review of research [did not find][jepson_cranberries_1998] any studies on using cranberry products for the treatment of urinary infections, and its [December 2023 update][jepson_cranberries_2023] did not find any neither. I mean, yes, there is evidence, but this comes from low-quality and very low-quality studies and from personal accounts. This is not considered good evidence anyway and is very uncertain, so reputable reviews don’t even bother looking at such evidence, only focusing on good trials.

But, there is something to discuss around the role of cranberries in prevention. This story was going to be about cranberry and urinary infections in general, but the flow of my research took an interesting turn, making me focus this post on pregnant women only.

![Cranberry UTI Evidence Journey](/images/{{ page.date | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}-{{ page.issue }}.jpg)

The World Health Organization [reports](https://www.who.int/health-topics/maternal-health#tab=tab_2) that about 140 million births take place each year. 140 million births mean way over 100 million pregnant women on planet Earth at any given time. At least 16% of these women suffer from pain and peeing difficulties arising from urinary infections, as [estimated][salari_global_2023] in a big study based on the data of over 30,600 pregnant women collected from 1964 to 2022. This gives us no less than 20 million pregnant people with urinary infections worldwide at any given time. A huge deal!

## What Do Pregnant Women Say About Urinary Infections?

The precious insights about how urinary infections feel in pregnancy, as told by 21 interviewed women and an additional 675 online users, are available to us, thanks to a 2022 study that [compiled][izett-kay_experiences_2022] a collection of qualitative research on urinary tract infections. 

1. A beautiful study [followed][almeida_hospitalizacao_2016] six women admitted to a specialized maternity hospital in Brazil over a 2-month period. All had a complicated pregnancy, and for all of them, this pregnancy was not their first. They were 20 to 27-year-old self-reported housewives. Only one of them completed primary school. The researchers asked them what they knew about urinary infection and how they felt about it. So, this sample seems to me like a very interesting and important perspective.

  None of the women knew exactly what urinary tract infection is, but some expressed concerns it is dangerous or painful. Some of them were also in pain. Almost all women said that they thought urinary infection is dangerous for the baby and that they could pass it to the baby, which could kill or mutilate the baby. Also, most felt bad about being at the hospital and wanted to go home as soon as possible.
1. Another team of scientists [conducted][ghouri_there_2020] phone interviews of 15 U.K. women who experienced urinary infection during pregnancy, which most of them had in the past 2 years. Most were about 30 years old and had a university degree. The researchers mostly asked the participants about their attitudes toward antibiotics, which all of them except one had taken for their urinary infection. The women mostly showed awareness about the problem of resistance to antibiotics and expressed willingness to reduce the need for antibiotics, if possible.
1. Finally, scientists [reviewed][ghouri_urinary_2019] an online U.K. forum for perceptions of pregnant women with urinary infections. Many women were worried about the potential harm the infection could do to their baby. As to antibiotics, some women advocated their use. Other women were pretty worried about the potential harms of taking antibiotics, particularly for the baby.

  Women talked about cranberry juice, too: One user mentioned that cranberry juice, purportedly, is okay to use if you weren’t pregnant, but in pregnancy better ask for antibiotics. One other folk, as a “UTI [urinary tract infection] veteran” advocated against cranberry juice; whereas, someone else said that they preferred taking cranberry juice or over-the-counter relief medications (some of which come with cranberry flavor, by the way) over taking antibiotics.

As we could see, urinary infections are a painful and worrisome problem for pregnant women, and cranberry juice and products are definitely a consideration – despite any good evidence of their effectiveness for treating urinary infections, as we saw above. But, what about prevention?

## Evidence About Cranberries for Preventing Urinary Infections

A major study was [published][williams_cranberries_2023] just recently, in November 2023, which was an update of the previous [2012 review][jepson_cranberries_2012]. The 2012 review found as many as 24 randomized trials with a total of over 4,400 participants (over 700 of them pregnant) and found moderate-certainty evidence of _no_ effectiveness of cranberry products for the prevention of urinary tract infections.

The updated review added an additional 26 randomized trials published over the past 11 years. This brings the total number of trials to 50, with a pooled sample of 8,900 participants. The updated meta-analysis showed a small but significant reduction in urinary tract infection risks in participants who consumed cranberry juice or cranberry products compared to those who took placebo, water, or no specific prescription. When subgroup analyses were performed, beneficial effects were found among women with recurrent urinary tract infections and among children but were not confirmed among elderly inpatients, patients with urinary leakage, and pregnant women. The incidence of side effects was not increased in the cranberry preparation group. The quality of evidence was mostly moderate.

## Top Hits on Google Are Ignorant of Important Evidence

I got interested in what the internet has to say about this and ran the simplest possible Google search: [cranberry + UTIs](https://www.google.com/search?q=cranberry+utis) (UTIs commonly stands for urinary tract infections). I looked at a couple of top hits, and here is what I found:

- Medical News Today, in their 2016 article, [features](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/306498) a description of their review process:

  _How we reviewed this article:_

  _SOURCES_

  _Medical News Today has strict sourcing guidelines and draws only from peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations. We avoid using tertiary references. We link primary sources — including studies, scientific references, and statistics — within each article and also list them in the resources section at the bottom of our articles. You can learn more about how we ensure our content is accurate and current by reading our editorial policy._

  Okay, but they just referenced [one trial](http://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2015.04.003) and failed to provide the context for it: the [2012 version][jepson_cranberries_2012] of the prevention review, which we looked at above, had been published 4 years ago at that time, and it showed no effectiveness. The trial they are covering suggested otherwise. The trial was accounted for in the [2023 update][williams_cranberries_2023] we also looked at above, so not to worry.
  
  So, a major review by the most reputable health systematic review organization worldwide (Cochrane), covering 24 randomized trials with over 4,400 participants and finding moderate-certainty evidence of _no_ effectiveness is lying out there for 4 years, but Medical News Today just chose to discard it (or did not make an effort to look up).
- HealthEssentials Cleveland Clinic [published](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/can-cranberry-juice-stop-uti) a post on cranberries in 2020. There was no info about their journalistic research process in the post.

  So, they are claiming:

  _One 2013 analysis of 13 different trials concluded that cranberry juice and tablets did reduce the occurrence of UTIs compared to placebo in women with recurrent UTIs. But another review found that they didn’t._

  They seem to be referring to [this](https://doi.org/10.1136/eb-2012-100984) report, which apparently is a provisional report of the review eventually [published](https://doi.org/10.1001/archinternmed.2012.3004) in full. Okay, no problem, but they are not referencing the [2012 Cochrane review][jepson_cranberries_2012], which had already been there for 8 years by then.

  Also, they refer to “another review,” which in fact, upon simply clicking the link, [is a randomized trial](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mayocp.2011.10.006) report, not a review. Just to let you know, this trial is included in the [2023 update][williams_cranberries_2023], so we are good to go. What’s more fun, and just to give you a glimpse of the thoroughness of a good systematic review – even the [2012 version][jepson_cranberries_2012] was aware of that trial despite that its results were published in the same year, 2012. To be more specific, they mentioned it in 2012 but did not have the time to incorporate the findings in the analysis, but the [2023 update][williams_cranberries_2023] did that.

  Going back to HealthEssentials Cleveland Clinic, after this series of misleading statements, they just asked some doctor who eventually gave some recommendations. Clearly, that’s not how you want to do health news.

Just to remind you, we are still talking only about prevention. Like, I did not specify this in my Google query, but that’s what those two top hit posts referred to. No mentions of treatment, although in practice people seem to use cranberry products for treatment, too, as we saw from women’s experiences above.

## ChatGPT Is Blissfully Unaware of the Evidence

Let’s also see what ChatGPT has got to say about this.

Zheln:

```
are cranberries effective against urinary tract infections?
```

ChatGPT:

```
Cranberries have been traditionally thought to be helpful in preventing urinary tract infections (UTIs). The idea is that certain compounds in cranberries may prevent bacteria, particularly Escherichia coli (E. coli), from adhering to the walls of the urinary tract, reducing the risk of infection.

The active compounds in cranberries are believed to be proanthocyanidins. These compounds are thought to interfere with the adhesion of bacteria to the urinary tract lining. However, the evidence regarding the effectiveness of cranberries in preventing or treating UTIs is mixed.

While some studies suggest that cranberry products, such as juice or supplements, may have a modest preventive effect, other research has not consistently supported this claim. It's important to note that cranberry products are not a substitute for medical treatment if you already have a UTI. If you suspect a urinary tract infection, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment, typically involving antibiotics.

If you're considering using cranberry products for UTI prevention, it's advisable to speak with your healthcare provider. They can provide personalized advice based on your health history and any existing medical conditions. Additionally, it's crucial to choose products that are low in added sugars, as excessive sugar intake can have negative health implications.
```

Ah, that suggestion about “mixed evidence” again. Maybe they work, maybe they don’t. I remind you that since 2012, there had been a major review published that covered 24 _randomized_ trials and over 4,400 patients and found _moderate-certainty_ (e.g., it could as well be low or very low, as is true for so many other questions, but not in this instance) of _no_ effectiveness. So to me, that’s pretty something, not “mixed” evidence.

Yes, the certainty in the evidence was not high, due to multiple trial quality issues, which suggested that conclusions might change. And, they did change in this case after the addition of 26 new trials over 11 years, as we saw above. In fact, this is what the scientific, evidence-based approach is all about: we do not claim effectiveness as long as there is no good evidence to claim it. So, by definition, evidence may accumulate. By contrast, “Maybe they work, maybe they don’t” does not lead anywhere and is no better than guessing at random.

## Bonus: How Scientific Truth Is Forged

Incidentally, I came across a very interesting case of how scientific truth is possible and how it is forged. Looking for qualitative research (interviews, studies of personal experiences) on urinary tract infections to give you an idea of what this condition looks like, I came across a systematic review on the use of cranberry for the prevention of urinary tract infections in pregnancy. I was fascinated to see how an altogether different team of researchers, employing the same systematic methodology but applying it totally independently, found the same set of 3 randomized trials and [came][bolgarina_cranberry_2023] to essentially the same conclusion as our big, overarching review on cranberries for prevention. On top of that, both reviews were published in the same year. This really illustrates how rigorous scientific methodology, if applied consistently, leads to about the same results, independently of whoever conducts the research. This is a truly fascinating property of science and a unique feature of scientific data – the relative independence from the observer.

As to the conclusion they concurrently came to, it’s that there are only several randomized trials on the use of cranberry products in pregnant women, and they did not show any reduction in urinary infection rates. Most trials are of poor quality, so odds are the conclusions might change if, theoretically, better studies are conducted in the future. What they did find was high dropout rates (at 30–50%), and the women reported intolerance of the high dosages of cranberry juice they were prescribed. The replacement of juice with pills helped a bit, but the dropout rates were still high. Something to think about, huh? What’s really mindblowing ­­– you could look up these trial reports if you wanted to, as they are available online. Now, that’s evidence.
