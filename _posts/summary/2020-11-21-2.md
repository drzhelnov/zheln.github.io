## Appraisals in Progress

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Alternatively, you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln
