## So What’s New?

* In the [previous summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/), I came to the conclusion all is ready for record screening and envisaged to [process 570 records per day](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/8#issuecomment-697119605).
* It is easy to calculate I should’ve processed **1,140 records** in these two days that passed since the previous summary.
* So how many records have I screened in these 30 hours?
* Well, just **three records**, actually ([one](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/02/3/), [two](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/02/4/), [three](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/02/5/)).

## Why So Few?

* Personally, it feels quite natural.
* First of all, when I set off appraising records, it quickly became evident the editable versions were deficient: I needed to change the record footers manually.
* Also, manual selection of the [record appraisal status](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#pubmed-search) turned out to be duplicate.
* So I needed to fix the [record-maker script](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/general-makeposti.sh) first.
* After [I’ve fixed the script](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/compare/626337b1862022e03515a3bfc22adce73071bbab..edb49911da27a6f822dec8cadc9ff5763526511f#diff-d556e85617be04293b0ad953ad7028b3), the next thing I noticed was that the [specialty tagging methodology](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#specialty-tagging) didn’t feel transparent enough; so I needed to [elaborate on these methods](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/compare/06dc0e66ab82b80138011b7afb7e7d4addf3fcb4..eef4e65ee88a1c9ae9544152014481c46801da3c#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8) first.
* Indeed, it goes without saying that all the above-mentioned changes necessitated corresponding website modifications, … and so on.
* Overall, it feels like the principal reason why, in almost a month of the Zheln’s uptime, just five records entered appraisal and none finished it is as follows:

    > Zheln’s methods and technology are still not production-ready after a month of development, which is perfectly normal for a systematic review such as this one, especially given that it’s massive, conducted by a single researcher, and crowdfunded only.

* _‘Smaller in number are we, but larger in mind.’_
* Forcing production now would amount to suicide.

## What’s Next?

* Anyway, speeding up is also critical for Zheln.
* Honestly, with 500 records added to the queue daily, anything less than a conveyor belt will fail.
* So the target of 570 appraisals per day remains, whereas the next week’s focus will be preserving quality while also smoothly increasing quantity.
* As the record debt starts to go down, I will adjust this target accordingly to account for the records missed during the current high-intensity but low-volume period.
* As to the other directions of Zheln development, namely [increasing appraisal _completion_](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/11) and [preparing an academic manuscript](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2), they will happily wait until proper record processing is settled.
