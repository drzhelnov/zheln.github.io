## How Are the Appraisals Going?

* I still fall short of the [expected mark of 570 appraisals per day](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/8#issuecomment-697119605).
* As an example, I downloaded 447 & 67 records since the last summary for Sep 26 & Sep 27, respectively.
* Sep 28 records are unavailable since [PubMed indexing failed](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/bd54ccb3bcd5904bebe13c6c4edc185e88bcf0e5) on this date, and Sep 29 records are unavailable yet because Iâ€™m waiting until the [day is over in the IDLW time zone](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/f2350f70ad3f2f6ceb3d060d17a4035ef2777f7d).
* So of these records, Iâ€™ve only appraised [nine](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/24).
* Clearly, this is a very large mismatch.
* Iâ€™m not entirely sure how Iâ€™m going to deal with it yet, but Iâ€™m already checking some steps, like [appraising records in a random order](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/f6268a12b1f3258f8bd4fdef3427abaeca0c708a) or documenting the [record debt](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/6f916cb5aaf7515ce79b045a68f262960f4a060c); so Iâ€™m certain, eventually, I will _find a way_.

## Appraisals by Subject

* The topic landscape is quite large with [90+ specialty tags already used](/browse/) in at least one appraisal.
* The most popular specialty is, predictably, [Family Medicine](/family-medicine/) / [General Practice](/general-practice/) that already contains **seven records** despite the current very low appraisal rate.
* Most of the systematic reviews Iâ€™ve appraised seem too narrow to me to embark autonomously on their appraisal.
* Therefore, these appraisals are put on hold until anyone shows interest in and crowdfunds them. Please [choose any specialty](/browse/) or [use the appraisal search](/search/) if you want a look at these.
* Also, it is still quite difficult to choose among specialty tags, but I [have polished these methods along the way](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#specialty-tagging).

## Featured Appraisals

* A few systematic reviews seem important enough and are likely to have a great practice impact.
* If I face one, I select it for full appraisal on my own initiative.
* Iâ€™ve got two such systematic reviews by now:
* How effective [behavioral weight-loss interventions in diabetes](/record/2020/09/02/1/) are?
* What is the [risk of congenital malformations associated with beta-blocker use in early pregnancy](/record/2020/09/27/6/)?
* Both of these, as I see it, are relatable to very large patient populations and, consequently, represent important public health concerns warranting wide awareness.
* You can expect completion of these appraisals [no earlier than Iâ€™ve established stable record triage](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#whats-next).
* In any case, Iâ€™m not to start full appraisals until [Iâ€™ve registered Zheln with PROSPERO](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#academic-status).
