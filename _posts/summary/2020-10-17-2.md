## New Appraisals in Progress

* How important is [postural control in Down syndrome](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/14/28/)?
* What works for [at-risk mental states](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/14/87/)?
* What is the effect of [ticagrelor monotherapy after PCI](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/09/15/)?
* How good is [social accountability for reproductive, maternal, newborn, child, and adolescent health](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/09/17/)?
* What is on the [American Psychiatric Association guideline on schizophrenia](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/09/302/)?
* `Crowdfunded` How effective are [tooth decay prevention measures in children 6 years old or younger](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/19/)? 

## Full Text Wanted!

These systematic reviews had been selected for full appraisal, but their full texts were unavailable to me. Please [contact me](#see-you-around-peer) if you wish to help procuring them.

* How effective are [anti-amyloid-β drugs for Alzheimer’s disease](https://zheln.com/record/2020/10/14/116/)?
* How is [homelessness experienced by transgender people](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/7/)?
* How useful is [physical exercise for people living with breast cancer](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/47/)?

## Zheln is 45. In Days!

* Zheln was conceived on Sep 2, 2020, [taking over from a 2019 project](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#what-is-this-repo) that aimed to discover all orthopedic systematic reviews on [PubMed](https://pubmed.gov).
* Eventually, this affiliation-free, crowdfunded, [open-science](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclinepi.2020.06.032) initiative that aims to monitor, critically appraise, and tag with [AMA specialties](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) all new [systematic reviews](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#record-screening) that are [indexed on PubMed](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#pubmed-search) was [first widely published](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/20/1/).
* I [produced this website](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#general-status) and [established biweekly status reports](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestones?state=closed), but the [appraisal count remained low](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#why-so-few) because of the overwhelming number of records to appraise.
* Then I [started introducing control measures](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#how-are-the-appraisals-going) that [did prove effective](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/03/2/). However, the [workload was still too high](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/07/1/), so that at times, [distress prevailed](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/10/2/).
* I did [invite collaborators](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#bonus) and even [took part in a hackathon](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/milestone/1); however, no one’s showed up yet. [Crowdfunding](#help-crowdfund-zheln), too, is lacking. 
* Eventually, I realized I needed to [write up a thorough nonprofit plan](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/14/1/#lieutenant-general-status) in addition to an [academic paper](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#academic-status). Both of these are [currently in development](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4).

## There Has Been an Awakening

* As I [wrote previously](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/14/1/#lieutenant-general-status), the estimated crowdfunding amount required to accomplish the [Zheln’s mission](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#zhelns-mission) is way too high for the start.
* But since then, I’ve found a [way to stay on budget](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720).
* To do that, I [reduced the workload to 10%](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/7ada9d590e08811142385a92ee50e79195084c38) while, at the same time, [following a tight schedule](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/22) and [dropping older unappraised records](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/44).
* This movement has already [proved highly effective](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/23?closed=1).
* Indeed, it would not allow to appraise **all** records but just one tenth of them; however, this is for starters, and this solution is highly scalable when Zheln becomes adequately crowdfunded.
* Overall, it would take me around **five hours daily** (except on Saturday, a day off) to be on schedule.
* And that’s great because I still have **one hour** to spend on the website maintenance incl. summary posts (estimated 30 hours a month in total) and **two more hours** a day to conduct full appraisals.

## What’s the Next Move?

* New record uploads have been restarted and the appraisal process has been put on schedule.
* As [previously mentioned](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals), I’m not doing full appraisals until I’ve established stable record triage (which, [as it appears](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/23?closed=1), I did).
* Also, I need to [write and register the protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) before I can embark on full appraisals.
* However, as I see it now, several full appraisals still need to be conducted now as a [piloting exercise](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/3#issuecomment-706716950) exactly because I need to carefully design the whole Zheln process to write the protocol and the [Zheln Manual](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36).
* Therefore, I will now move to full appraisals, which, of note, consist of [18 records awaiting](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Legacy_Appraisals_Table.md) and are expected to grow as the estimated _number needed to appraise_ before one record is selected for full appraisal features roughly every **eighth record.**
* Expect a report on how full appraisals are going in the next summary post on [Wed, Oct 21](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/24)!

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
