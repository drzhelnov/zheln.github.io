## Status Report

* There are **179 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* Moreover, I annotated all of them with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.
* So you can [browse Zheln by AMA Specialty](/browse/) or use [free-text search](/search/).
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing **tens of thousands of records per month,** of which I’m currently struggling to process [10% daily](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).
* However, I’ve been persistently failing [my worked-time target](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f7c6f3d5362942865bd4ba61e302cae1acdc642c/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) as well as [my working schedule](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/07/2/#status-report).
* In particular, I have conducted no new appraisals since the [last summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/07/2/).
* You can examine my performance since the previous summary in more detail using the flow diagram below, modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway).

## Come On, Man!

* I already wrote about the [reasons for my stalling](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-going-on).
* Still, I haven’t figured out how to get out of this situation, so please keep following my progress and get back for updates on [Sat, Nov 14](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/56); it’s really hard on me, believe me.
* I’m planning to [start posting videos](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/87) reporting day-by-day progress. Moreover, I’m starting to feel this could give me the right impact to streamline appraisals.
* Please follow my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) and [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@drzhelnov) accounts to catch the upcoming updates.
* The full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the [Zheln nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4) will be published separately for Zheln Primary and Full Appraisals. I can’t give you the dates yet, so please stay tuned too.
* Once I’ve finalized the protocols, I will also start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few [select reviews](#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.

## Appraisals in Progress

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Alternatively, you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
