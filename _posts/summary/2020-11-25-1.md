## Zheln Flow Diagram

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Nov 25, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-11-25-1.png)

This is the Zheln flow diagram, modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway).

## Zheln Systematic Reviews

* There are **378 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving **most systematic reviews being published** in peer-reviewed international health care journals.
* As this is tens of thousands of records a month, I’m currently struggling to process [random 10% of Zheln records daily](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening). Follow appraisal progress using [my open performance metrics](#my-performance-metrics) below.
* I’m also tagging the records with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).
* Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is [under development](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for [Oct 30](https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), [Oct 31](https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), [Nov 10](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 13](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 20](https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), [Nov 21](https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), or [Nov 22](https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/) records.
* Otherwise, you can watch Zheln records on the [YouTube channel for Zheln](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, [Oct 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and [Nov 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM) video summaries are available).

## What’s Next?

_**Get Back for the Next Summary Post on [Wed, Nov 25](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/70)**_

* Appraisals are not going well because assigning short titles and specialty tags to all appraised records is a tedious activity and also for the [reasons already named](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-going-on).
* This is why I’m going to assign short titles to the records selected for full appraisal only. Also, I’m going to finally start [full appraisals](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/714748ca646d2d3582625f481e0e0f01380fb8a4/README.md#full-appraisal-stage).
* As to the rest of the records, I’m going to assign them tags taken from the newly-developed tag list (not published yet). [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/714748ca646d2d3582625f481e0e0f01380fb8a4/README.md#specialty-tagging) will have to be dropped.
* In the end, I’m going to review all these records in [videos recorded daily](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ). In addition, I have already got enough content to record the [Nov 13](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 20](https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), [Nov 21](https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), and [Nov 22](https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/) videos, so I’m going to do this too.
* As to the full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the [Zheln nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4), I’m not ready to write up these yet as Zheln production process is still unstable. Current methods are available from the [Zheln methods repository](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/714748ca646d2d3582625f481e0e0f01380fb8a4/README.md).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
