## Zheln Is Your New Way to Experience Health News

### Health News Are Often Misleading, but Not on Zheln

This is because only a single primary study is often presented, **whereas on Zheln, you’ll find systematic reviews of studies only.** [Search for reviews](/search/) now!

Also, the studies themselves may be misleading due to various problems arising from their conduct. Any comprehensive analysis of these problems or attempts to reproduce the review findings are rarely undertaken, **while Zheln reviews are critically appraised thoroughly with focused replication** (please check the [academic Zheln protocol](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb) to see for yourself how good our methods are).

At the same time, spurious results are easily disseminated in health news. **On Zheln, we cautiously propagate only the most credible, hard-won evidence.** Watch [Zheln Health News videos on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b) or consult the [list of reviews currently under appraisal](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/26/2/#list-of-included-studies).

Health news agencies are also rarely, if ever, independent entities. **In contrast, Zheln is fully affiliation-free, [fully open](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects), nonprofit, and supported by crowdfunding only.** Please [help support Zheln](https://opencollective.com/zheln/donate).

> This combination of _systematicness,_ _caution,_ and _independence_ ultimately makes Zheln your best source of news about health.
