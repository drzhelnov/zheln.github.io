<small>Zhelnov P. Struggling to get on track. Zheln. 2020 Nov 4;45(1):s14e1. URI: {{ page.url | absolute_url }}.</small>

## Status Report

* Now it’s **170 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* Moreover, I annotated all of them with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.
* So you can [browse Zheln by AMA Specialty](/browse/) or use [free-text search](/search/).
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing **tens of thousands of records per month,** of which I’m currently struggling to process [10% daily](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).
* In the [previous Zheln summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/), I wrote about my plan to improve performance; however, I [wasn’t terribly successful](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=appraise+in%3Atitle+is%3Aissue+closed%3A2020-11-01..2020-11-03+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+) in the past three days.
* Also, [as you can now see](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/0ac36839d5dc9452b9e63bcce03f922935d10df5/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md), I worked for only **11 hours** this week while I should have worked for **24 hours** in total.
* The reasons for that were listed in that [latest summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/), too, so this is really the best I can do for now.
* In the future summary posts, I’m planning to use [PRISMA 2020 flow diagrams](https://github.com/drzhelnov/SRflowdiagram/issues/1) to display progress.
* Also, I’m planning to [start posting YouTube videos](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/87) reporting day-by-day progress.
* However, these new features as well as the full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the [Zheln nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4) are on hold until I recover and ensure a stable appraisal pace, which is critical for Zheln survival.
* Once I’ve finalized the protocol, I will also start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few [select reviews](#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.

## Appraisals in Progress

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Alternatively, you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
