## Status Report

* Now it’s **179 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* Moreover, I annotated all of them with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.
* So you can [browse Zheln by AMA Specialty](/browse/) or use [free-text search](/search/).
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing **tens of thousands of records per month,** of which I’m currently struggling to process [10% daily](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).
* In the [previous Zheln summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/04/1/), I wrote about my persistently bad performance as well as the reasons for it.
* Sadly, it has not changed much.
* You can examine my performance in more detail using this freshly-cut flow diagram, modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway):

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Nov 7, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-11-07-2.png)

* In total, as of now, I have **1,017 records of debt.** Also, [as you can see](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b96852232d9e80babf7356497a947175b064ab7a/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md), I worked for only about **24 hours** this week while I should have worked for **48 hours** in total or _twice_ more.
* Honestly, I’m not quite sure how to proceed. So I guess, for now, I’ll just keep appraising records and watching how it goes.
* Also, I want to modify and better specify my weekly schedule while also maintaining the [120 records of debt per week](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-gonna-happen-in-november) target.
* Here is what my new schedule will look like:
    
    * Sun (Sun 7am EST – Mon 7am EST): 10% Fri.
    * Mon (Mon 7am EST – Tue 7am EST): 10% Sat and 10% Sun.
    * Tue (Tue 7am EST – Wed 7am EST): 10% Mon + Wed summary. Wed summary should report: Fri, Sat, Sun, and Mon.
    * Wed (Wed 7am EST – Thu 7am EST): 10% Tue.
    * Thu (Thu 7am EST – Fri 7am EST): 10% Wed.
    * Fri (Fri 7am EST – Sat 7am EST): 10% Thu + Sat summary. Sat summary should report: Tue, Wed, and Thu.
    * Sat (Sat 7am EST – Sun 7am EST): day off.

* I’m still planning to [start posting YouTube videos](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/87) reporting day-by-day progress, but I really want to stay focused on the appraisals for the time being, so it will wait.
* And so will the full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the [Zheln nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4). It is of note, however, that I’m thinking about publishing the protocols for Zheln Primary and Full Appraisals separately to expedite publication of the first formal protocol for Zheln.
* Once I’ve finalized the protocols, I will also start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few [select reviews](#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.
* Finally, I must acknowledge a concurrent project: the translation of the [PRISMA 2020](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/P93GE) into Russian. It will also take much of my time, so some corrections to the Zheln schedule will likely be necessary.
* From the other hand, I’m planning to run a [separate campaign to crowdfund my translation](https://zhelnov-to-editors.github.io/), that could also raise awareness of Zheln as a by-product.

## Appraisals in Progress

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Alternatively, you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
