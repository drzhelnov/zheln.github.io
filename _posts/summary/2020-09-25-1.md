## Oh, I Am Sorry, Frodo

* In the [previous summary](/summary/2020/09/20/1), I announced _this_ summary to come out on Sep 23.
* However, itâ€™s Sep 25 now that itâ€™s actually coming out.
* Personally, I find it a zero-tolerance event and apologize to you for it; hereâ€™s what Iâ€™m going to do to prevent summary delays in future.
* I made a separate `In progress â€“ High priority` column in the GitHub kanban of the [Streamline Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/1) project. From now on, all summary publication issues will go there.
* Essentially, that means I work on the summaries first thing, writing about whatâ€™s done to this point, and resisting the temptation to outperform myself at the last moment.
* It is worth noting the [next summary publication milestone](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/10) was set on **Sep 27**; that is, I will publish the next summary tomorrow by the end of the day (EDT).
* I have great plans for today and tomorrow (see below), so the tomorrowâ€™s summary should not feel worn.
* So anyway, please get back for updates **this Sunday**! ðŸ˜ƒ

## General Status

* I spent most of the last five days since the previous summary getting the website and appraisal tools ready for work (see the [full diff](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/compare/01a547ad0af294a1e8cc2bdd540a22e3c68f64b7..8ac41506fd1b4008981777f78807f355134e18fb) for more info).
* And effectively, Iâ€™ve succeeded in it.
* As of now, Zheln is a _fully armed and operational battle station_ with the website working correctly and [_General Makeposti_](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/general-makeposti.sh), a tailored tool to appraise records, at hand.
* Overall, this means I can, at long last, go on with the very record appraisals.
  
## Started Appraisals

* As to how many records are stuck awaiting appraisal, this is a tough problem.
* In fact, I have appraised just _2 out of 5,609 records_ by now.
* Moreover, there is about the same number of records awaiting download from PubMed (estimated [ 5,609 Ã· 12 ] Ã— 11 â‰ˆ 5,148 records); these are the records that appeared in the [Replicated Systematic Review Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#pubmed-search) Sep 14 thru Sep 24.
* Therefore, I need to start appraising these records ASAP, while also doing concurrent up-to-date appraisals.
* For this purpose, I devised a [plan to keep up with appraisals](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/8#issuecomment-697119605).
* It would allow me to close the 10k-record debt in two months, while appraising 22% more records daily.
* See how it all works out in the next summary post **this Sunday!**

## Completed Appraisals

* **No appraisals** have been fully completed by now.
* This is a problem Iâ€™m going to solve after Iâ€™ve established a stable flow of started appraisals.
* Effectively, by the moment a record is moved at least one status level up from `awaiting appraisal`, it has likely also been specialty tagged, which already means its successful exposition at the target specialty pages.
* Therefore, expediting _completed_ appraisals is currently a natural lower priority than streamlining _started_ appraisals.
* Also, withholding processing of full texts (i.e. stopping appraisal at the [Zheln Step 3](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries#the-ten-steps)) is preferable while registration of Zheln as a research project is pending (see below).

## Academic Status

* One last thing Iâ€™ve done since the previous summary is [elaborating on the Zheln methods](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/compare/521d92e419341fe44d0ce5e3227828373a8eef89..a887d7a806eb89c497343fb33b847e5732c2c58b#diff-04c6e90faac2675aa89e2176d2eec7d8).
* This is a very preliminary account; however, a more detailed account is also in the plans as Iâ€™ve decided to [register Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) with [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/), a prospective registry of systematic reviews! Zhelnâ€™s designed as a _living systematic review_; thus, it requires prospective registration.
* After inspecting the [PROSPERO registration guidance](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#guidancenotes), I did not find any issues that would preclude registration of Zheln, albeit a great protocol would be required.
* I also considered publishing the protocol in a peer-reviewed journal when ready.
* However, as I want it to be an Open Access publication, preferably in [BMC _Syst Rev_](https://systematicreviewsjournal.biomedcentral.com/submission-guidelines/fees-and-funding), who charge $2,170 per article, Iâ€™d better wait until this is fully crowdfunded and then publish a feature article. Please [help me crowdfund it](#zheln-is-supported-by-crowdfunding-only)!
* In the meantime, Iâ€™m going with free-of-charge options such as writing and submitting the protocol to PROSPERO and [publishing Zheln on OSF (already done)](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/EJKFC).
* I have not set any milestones here yet but will do that as soon as Iâ€™ve got records processed at a steady pace; this is clearly a lower-priority endeavor.
