## Status Anginosus

* The [protocol](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) is still in the works. I’d very much like to finalize and submit it to PROSPERO by Mon, Oct 12. You can [track the progress](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2).
* Zheln is [getting ready](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/34) to participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com)! I’ve incidentally learned about this event on Twitter. This gives a chance to see how [crowdsourcing appraisals](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#bonus) could actually look like. Zheln will enrol shortly in line with the protocol write-up.
* I’ve conducted no new appraisals since the [last summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/07/1/). Just after I’m done with the protocol, I’m taking up this issue very seriously to set a stable appraisal schedule.

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
