## Zheln Flow Diagram

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Dec 2, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-12-02-1.png)

This is the Zheln flow diagram, modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway).

## Status Description

[Work Schedule](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/fd825102e53b5d9a3222d655a44f5baa5224de4e/zheln/Work_Schedule.md) | [Worked-Time Target](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/fd825102e53b5d9a3222d655a44f5baa5224de4e/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) | [Appraisal Log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/fd825102e53b5d9a3222d655a44f5baa5224de4e/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md)

* There are **605 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/fd825102e53b5d9a3222d655a44f5baa5224de4e/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving **most systematic reviews being published** in peer-reviewed international health care journals.
* I’m also tagging the records with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).
* I used to appraise only [random 10% of Zheln records daily](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening) because of resource constraints, but I have [considerably reworked the appraisal process](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/1e697d9dafaf79db8be72cf1598415a8565ae511), so I’m [targeting 100% of appraisals](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/fd825102e53b5d9a3222d655a44f5baa5224de4e/zheln/Work_Schedule.md) now. It is a very recent development, so things may yet change; stay tuned.
* Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is [under development](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for [Oct 30](https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), [Oct 31](https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), [Nov 10](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 13](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 20](https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), [Nov 21](https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), [Nov 22](https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/), or [Nov 25](https://zheln.com/2020/11/25/) records.
* Otherwise, you can watch Zheln records on the [YouTube channel for Zheln](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, [Oct 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and [Nov 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM), and [Nov 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ePQA5-peE) videos are available). Separate videos for each full appraisal are upcoming.
* A full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) has made a huge leap forward since the [last summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/28/2/), so I’m planning to complete it and [submit to PROSPERO for registration](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/16) soon. I cannot give you any specific date yet, but this is very likely to happen within a week or two, because I am currently ready to do appraisals in full but cannot do that until the protocol has been registered (as reviews that have entered the data extraction stage are [not accepted for registration in PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#guidancenotes)). Meanwhile, please consult [draft Zheln methodology](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/tree/global-sr-query) to learn about Zheln methods in detail.

## List of Included Studies

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. [COVID-19 publications are not selected](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905). However, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Some of the appraisals are already available as videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ), so click the <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> button next to the appraisal heading to watch them!

I’m also going to be busy [translating the PRISMA 2020 Statement into Russian](https://doir.org10.17605/OSF.IO/QDMU6) this week, so some Zheln hindrance is imminent.

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
