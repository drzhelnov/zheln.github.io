## What Exactly Is Zheln?

[Work Schedule](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/007b3f5922f816651ad47818c7f48e73d9fb7ef5/zheln/Work_Schedule.md) | [Worked-Time Log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/007b3f5922f816651ad47818c7f48e73d9fb7ef5/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) | [Appraisal Log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/007b3f5922f816651ad47818c7f48e73d9fb7ef5/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md)

In practice, Zheln has got two components: _Zheln Records_ and _Zheln Appraisals_ aka _**Health Science News.**_

### Zheln Records

* _Zheln Records_ are records that came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://https://doi.org/10.17605/osf.io/z3ju7) PubMed query retrieving **most of all systematic reviews being published.** They are different from plain PubMed records in that I’m tagging them with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can [browse Zheln Records by AMA Specialty](/browse/), whereas on PubMed, locating all records relevant to your specialty requires use of very extensive search strategies and is, in practice, unfeasible. Of course, [Zheln Record Search](/search/) is also available.
* They are added daily (unless [PubMed fails, and it does](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov/status/1339909838994862082)), most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews. There are **864 recent systematic review** records on Zheln currently.
* As you can see from the [Zheln appraisal log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md) and from the [flow diagram below](#zheln-flow-diagram), only a (random) fraction of Replicated Systematic Subset records is processed as Zheln Records currently because this is a very high workload (roughly **500** new records **daily** on average), but not to worry: As soon as I crowd-raise [enough money to keep Zheln running ($600/mo)](#help-crowdfund-zheln), I will make artificial intelligence do the stuff (in fact, it could manage even better than I do). This will involve discussions with machine learning specialists in evidence synthesis, such as [Iain Marshall](https://twitter.com/ijmarshall), and will allow stable processing of 100% of records. 

### Health Science News

* When I skim through the Zheln Records, I select the most appealing systematic reviews, critically appraise and replicate them, and record [two-minute summary videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b) targeted at general audiences.
* As a rule, I select a review for a critical appraisal with replication when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. [COVID-19 publications are not selected](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905). 
* [Crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is also possible.
* Some of the appraisals are already available as [Health Science News on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFEBgL83-LaeNC-ZT3_qyy-b). Also, I make some of these [natively available in Russian](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLspUa13rQFHaL88JqTZbIIbeQRRwPqK9). Finally, all of these are also available from the [Zheln Instagram channel](https://www.instagram.com/igzheln).

## Scientific Nuts & Bolts

* Zheln is not only an affiliation-free, nonprofit, health-educational project but also a formal scientific study. 
* Read the preprint of the full-featured academic protocol for the Zheln overview of systematic reviews: [DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.
* It has not been peer-reviewed yet, but I’m eager! I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do [engage me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or [elsewhere](#give-feedback-and-spread-the-word)!
* Also, I have started contacting the authors and publishers of the systematic reviews I appraise (first [on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov), then, if no answer, by email) to collect more feedback and possibly resolve any content misunderstandings at my end. Please [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/drzhelnov) to engage in public discussions; I’m really looking forward to this!

## Zheln Flow Diagram

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Dec 19, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-12-19-2.png)

This is the Zheln flow diagram. It shows the flow of systematic reviews on Zheln since the [last summary post](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/16/1/). The flow diagram is modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway). I am deeply grateful to the original authors!
