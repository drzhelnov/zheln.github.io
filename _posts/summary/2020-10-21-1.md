## What Does Zheln Give?

There are **123 recent systematic review** records on the [Zheln website](https://zheln.com) now, most published this fall, added daily, each:

* Counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews (means they, indeed, _are_ systematic)
* Annotated with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list

As a result, you can enjoy a current and [Open-Access](https://www.openaccess.nl/en/what-is-open-access) list of the most recent systematic reviews in any AMA specialty on their respective [specialty pages](https://zheln.com/browse/).

In the near future, as soon as I [register an academic protocol](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) for this project, thorough critical appraisals of a few [selected reviews](#appraisals-in-progress) will also become publicly available. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

## Where Are These Records From?

These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) query that differs from the regular [PubMed Systematic Reviews Filter](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html) query in that it:

* Incorporates the more sensitive, [legacy February 2017 version](http://web.archive.org/web/20181023065423/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/bsd/pubmed_subsets/sysreviews_strategy.html)
* Allows for more precise replication of the record subset

From Sep 1 to Oct 19, 2020, the query produced **23,827 records.**

Of these thousands of records, I appraised **158 records (0.6%)** to date. For the **last four days** since the [latest summary post](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/), I’ve been appraising [10% daily](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2020-10-16..2020-10-21+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and will [keep up the pace](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+created%3A%3E%3D2020-10-16+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+).

Of the records appraised, in turn, **35 records (22%)** did not meet the [Shojania & Bero 2001 criteria](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#record-screening) and were excluded from further processing. However, they are still accessible on the website via the [search box](https://zheln.com/search/).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
