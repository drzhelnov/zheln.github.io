## Zheln Flow Diagram

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Dec 5, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-12-05-2.png)

This is the Zheln flow diagram, modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway).

## Status Description

[Work Schedule](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1fc68f718f960d5dcb7504679f2b96bc971a039e/zheln/Work_Schedule.md) | [Worked-Time Target](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1fc68f718f960d5dcb7504679f2b96bc971a039e/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) | [Appraisal Log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1fc68f718f960d5dcb7504679f2b96bc971a039e/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md)

* **At last, I have finalized and published a full-featured academic protocol for Zheln!** You can find and read it here for free: [DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.
* I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do [engage me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere!
* There are **723 recent systematic review** records on Zheln currently. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/ed133624017e0333ee31ae175fc7fa459fcf695d/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving **most of all systematic reviews being published** in peer-reviewed international health care journals.
* I’m also tagging the records with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).
* Browsing by PubMed-indexing date is [under development](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/101)—see how it looks like for [Oct 30](https://zheln.com/2020/10/30/), [Oct 31](https://zheln.com/2020/10/31/), [Nov 10](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 13](https://zheln.com/2020/11/10/), [Nov 20](https://zheln.com/2020/11/20/), [Nov 21](https://zheln.com/2020/11/21/), [Nov 22](https://zheln.com/2020/11/22/), [Nov 25](https://zheln.com/2020/11/25/), or [Nov 27](https://zheln.com/2020/11/27/) records.
* Otherwise, you can watch Zheln records on the [YouTube channel for Zheln](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, [Oct 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and [Nov 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM), and [Nov 25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ePQA5-peE) videos are available). Since recently, I endeavor to publish one video-recorded critical appraisal of an important systematic review daily (two videos are available yet, please see the links in the [appraisal list below](#list-of-included-studies)).
* Unfortunately, due to very high load of records, [I do miss some appraisal days](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), and the [amount of time I spend on Zheln activities](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) has varied. I have chosen to follow the [Okazaki-fragments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragments) (or conveyor-belt) strategy in this regard: whenever I missed something, I usually do not go back but proceed further. I believe this is most appropriate for Zheln, due to its very living nature. In the future, however, when more staff (more than only me) is available, Zheln will definitely go stable.

## List of Included Studies

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. [COVID-19 publications are not selected](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905). However, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Some of the appraisals are already available as videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ), so click the <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> button next to the appraisal heading to watch them!

## What’s Next?

_**Get back for the next summary post on [Wed, Dec 9](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/79)**_

* [Follow new video-appraisals on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ)
* [Read the Zheln protocol](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb)
* [Watch Zheln gain full appraisal power](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md)

I’m also currently busy [translating the PRISMA 2020 Statement into Russian](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/QDMU6), hence some Zheln hindrance.

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**

If you want Zheln to live on, please use one of these options:
