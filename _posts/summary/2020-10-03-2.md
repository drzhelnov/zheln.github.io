## General Status

* For a week now that Zheln is [fully-armed and operational](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/), I‚Äôve been busy appraising records.
* In the previous summaries, [quality over quantity](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/27/2/#why-so-few) was emphasized and the [first appraisals](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals) were reported.
* In the last three days, I‚Äôve managed to conduct [nine appraisals](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/704cd2a6f257930d534dd1e1426a6ab5798fd1fd) only (none complete).
* For the record, this is the exact same number of appraisals I conducted [earlier](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#how-are-the-appraisals-going).
* However, this time it took around **two minutes** per record instead of the estimated **ten minutes** per record or **five times faster.**
* However, these measurements are very preliminary and more research in this direction is coming. I‚Äôve already set up this super [Thyme](https://joaomoreno.github.io/thyme/) app by [Jo√£o Moreno](https://github.com/joaomoreno). üòè
* But how did get this far?
* On the one hand, I‚Äôve [reformatted the editable version of a record](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/8ca4b14a8bb0a394f4ed5565945b31843439104f) to boost its usability.
* From the other hand, I‚Äôve [reduced the number of specialty tags to one](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/a1f14118677038b80c1afb38b0fcf1f76f87fe5a) during initial appraisal. Then, to add more specialty tags to these records, I will conduct _Specialty Tagging Sessions_ twice a week.
* See how it all works out in the next summary post on [Wed, Oct 7](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/17)!

## Academic Status

* At first, I did not consider [writing up an academic Zheln publication](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/25/1/#academic-status) a high priority.
* But then, I realized the delay in publication of the Zheln protocol actually tampered with both [full appraisals](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals) and [public relations](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/3).
* Therefore, I [sped up](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) the Zheln protocol development and [endeavor](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/16) to submit it to [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) by Oct 5, 2020, to allow [five business days](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#guidancenotes) for its processing.
* Watch Zheln academic progress in the next summary post on [Wed, Oct 7](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/17)!

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I‚Äôve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can‚Äôt be sure Zheln isn‚Äôt suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
