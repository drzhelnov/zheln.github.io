<small>Zhelnov P. A calling to you. Zheln. 2020 Oct 24;43(2):s2e2. URI: {{ page.url | absolute_url }}.</small>

## Status Report

* Now itâ€™s **134 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* Moreover, I annotated all of them with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.  
* So you can [browse Zheln by AMA Specialty](/browse/) or use [free-text search](/search/).
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing **tens of thousands of records per month,** of which I currently manage to process **10% daily** (there has been [some debt lately](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/1) that is an equivalent of estimated 32 work hours, actually, but Iâ€™ll hopefully recover from it by the [next summary post on Wed, Oct 28](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/30)).
* Until the end of 2020, Zheln is funded by myself; but Iâ€™m off other jobs now, so Iâ€™ll likely be forced to suspend Zheln in 2021 unless [crowdfunded](#help-crowdfund-zheln). But if you do donate even $1, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.
* By the way, I got approved into <i class="fab fa-github-alt"></i> [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), so Iâ€™m now accepting support there too! ðŸ˜Š
* Full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2), built with the bleeding-edge [PRISMA 2020](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) in mind, is [still in the works](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2), as is the [Zheln nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4); hope to complete _both_ by **Sat, Oct 31.**
* Once Iâ€™ve finalized the protocol, I will also start conducting _thorough_ critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few [select reviews](#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.
* In the near future, as soon as Iâ€™ve secured stable crowdfunding, I will start to actively build the team to process and appraise more and more incoming systematic review records, so that, finally, Zheln was able to give you _rigorous, independent, and open-access critical appraisal_ for **almost all new systematic reviews in the world.**
* For this to become reality, at least 10 appraisers are required, so stay in touch and please [help me crowdfund this thing](#help-crowdfund-zheln)!

## Appraisals in Progress

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. Iâ€™ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you canâ€™t be sure Zheln isnâ€™t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
