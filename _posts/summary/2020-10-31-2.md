> * I have failed <s>you Anakin</s> to complete the Zheln protocol by the end of October
> * However, failures are a good thing preventing Zheln from launching too early
> * That’s why I’m spending November appraising records and closing appraisal debts
> * I’ll get back to writing the protocol & business plan once I feel I can manage

## Where Is the Protocol?

* In the [previous Zheln summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/), I wrote I was about to write the protocol by today, Oct 31.
* However, I haven’t done it.
* Also, I wrote some record appraisal debt had accumulated. Here, too, not only haven’t I closed it yet but have also let it grow further.

## What’s Going On?

* Effectively, I’ve been feeling somewhat depressed about all of it.
* Coupled with worries about longevity of Zheln, lack of funding for 2021, zero public interest in the project so far, and relapses of my atopic dermatitis debilitating and turning my daily sleep into a mess, it has become the thing preventing me from moving on.
* As this is an absolutely destructive way of running Zheln, today, I’m _voting for a change._

## What’s Gonna Happen in November?

* I [have calculated](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?page=2&q=appraise+is%3Aissue+created%3A2020-10-16..2020-10-30+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+-closed%3A%3C%3D2020-10-30) there is currently a debt of **694 records** (assuming the [10%-per-day appraisal rate](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening)).
* My pragmatic median [primary record appraisal](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#staged-record-appraisal) time is **6 minutes** ([measurement 1](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/8422dce13da694cee3097194969749360df27095); [measurement 2](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/c27e551802bec6501377c120dc13dc6a41f8dcfe); [measurement 3](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/248d7df31f1a35023b1db82afc320cc69d86bb9a)).
* At the same time, my target average daily work capacity on Zheln, with no full appraisals currently possible while the [registration in PROSPERO](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) is pending because reviews that have started data extraction are [not accepted for registration](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#aboutregpage), is [6 hours a day](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening) except on Saturdays (days off).
* Therefore, assuming eight work hours a day, I should be able to appraise **20 additional records daily.**
* Overall, this amounts to **35 workdays** or six weeks to get out of the record appraisal debt.
* So, to ensure stability, **120 records of debt** should be appraised by the end of each week. I’ve already set these milestones on GitHub ([Nov 8](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/38); [Nov 15](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/39); [Nov 22](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/40); [Nov 29](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/41); [Dec 6](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/42); [Dec 13](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/milestone/43)).
* Obviously, I can’t influence my dermatitis and sleep issues much (as I’m already receiving all available treatments), so some changes to this schedule may be necessary. Anyway, that’s what [agile planning we’re using](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects) is there for, and summary posts twice a week, that have been [published persistently for five weeks in a row](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues?q=summary+on+site+%26+socials+is%3Aissue+closed%3A2020-09-27..2020-10-30+project%3Adrzhelnov%2Fzheln.github.io%2F1+) now, will stand.
* As to the Zheln [protocol](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) and [nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36) writing, I’m not able to do it now. First, I’m going to be totally busy appraising records, and I don’t want to ruin that. Second, I just can’t be sure I’m really able to run Zheln in a long term unless I have demonstrated I’ve got out of the debt and have been following the appraising schedule consistently for a considerable period.
* Thus, I’m going to focus on achieving stable 10%-per-day appraisal rates and appraisal-debt recovery in November.
* If I feel the appraisal pace has strengthened enough, and if I have time to spare, I’ll get back to writing the Zheln Manual early. The first thing will be conducting pilot full appraisals to break down the full-appraisal process.
* Overall, I feel this downward slope in the Zheln’s life is a good thing because it is a great test of the project survival.

## Status Report

* No new appraisals have been conducted on Zheln since the [last summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/).
* Please consult the latter for current lists of [appraisals in progress](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/#appraisals-in-progress) and [appraisals with missing full texts](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/28/1/#full-text-wanted).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
