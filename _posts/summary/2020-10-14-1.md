## New Appraisals in Progress

* How good is [C-reactive protein measurement with regard to health outcomes](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/10/)?
* What is the association between [sugar-free gum and dental caries](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/21/)?
* How big is the [impact of perinatal care systems on infant mortality](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/36/)?
* How effective is [empathy training in health care education](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/37/)?
* What are the [current therapeutic applications of human mesenchymal stem cells](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/45/)?
* How useful is [patient blood management to improve outcomes of major surgery](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/46/)?

## Full Text Wanted!

* How is [homelessness experienced by transgender people](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/7/)?
* How useful is [physical exercise for people living with breast cancer](https://zheln.com/record/2020/09/27/47/)?

## General Status

* No new records have been downloaded from PubMed since the [last summary](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/10/2/).
* However, I have finally conducted [primary appraisals](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#staged-record-appraisal) of [67 older records](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/30), which is the largest appraisal session on Zheln to date; therefore, there has been a major update on the Zheln website.
* In addition to the three full systematic review appraisals featured earlier ([two](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/09/30/1/#featured-appraisals) + [one](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/07/1/#general-status)), there are now [six more](#new-appraisals-in-progress)! Also, [two more](#full-text-wanted) were selected but are lacking full text. Please [contact me](#see-you-around-peer) if you wish to help procuring them.
* Now the 67 records appraised are in the middle of getting [fully specialty-tagged](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#specialty-tagging) as part of their Zheln appraisal process. Also, Iâ€™m using these tagging sessions to calculate the [time required to specialty-tag a record](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/30#issuecomment-706717187).

## Administrative Status

* From an administrative standpoint, Zheln is in constant jeopardy, to be honest, with funding and human resources critically lacking.
* It has become very clear now that with my solitary involvement, the [Zhelnâ€™s mission](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#zhelns-mission) is unattainable. Therefore, I need to raise resources.
* Per my latest calculations (see the [pre-latest](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/5aca665eb3f5f0a7c63a186480f6efed40bacebb)), **nine full-time workers** will be required, at the very least: **three** full-time [primary appraisers](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#staged-record-appraisal), **five** full-time [specialty-taggers](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#specialty-tagging), and at least **one** half-full-appraiser, half-website-maintainer.
* With a wage of **$15 per hour,** that I consider a minimum pay, and a maximum **48-hour working week,** this will amount to the required crowdfunding of **$25,920 per month,** which is quite a figure!
* Therefore, Iâ€™m resorting to writing a full-scale nonprofit business plan to carefully think things overâ€”[The Zheln Manual](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36).
* In the light of considerations above, the [academic protocol](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/21) is still pending, will go along with the [Manual](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/36).
* I believe I can make it in the forecoming two weeks.
* Track the administrative progress in a separate Zheln kanban specifically for [Full-Scale Launch](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4). ðŸš€ðŸ˜Ž
* Also, I have created a separate project to collect ideas on [how to improve Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/5), but thatâ€™s for later. ðŸ˜‰

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. Iâ€™ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you canâ€™t be sure Zheln isnâ€™t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**
