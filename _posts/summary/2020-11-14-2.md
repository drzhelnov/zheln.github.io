## Status Report

* There are **259 recent systematic review** records on Zheln. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* Moreover, I annotated most of them with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1c90dfbbbbb9f85603f2686d1132039922dad874/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list.
* So you can [browse Zheln by AMA Specialty](/browse/) or use [free-text search](/search/). Also, you can watch short day-by-day video updates on the [YouTube channel for Zheln](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ) (currently, [Oct 31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzGZIvpz-P4) and [Nov 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OooxD0poFvM) video summaries are available).
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/00eae711e5b5c09b9b4181688f9a6191e42cb720/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query, producing **tens of thousands of records per month,** of which I’m currently struggling to process [10% daily](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/17/2/#there-has-been-an-awakening).
* However, I’ve been persistently failing [my worked-time target](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/1e12a395a75d86af4c46811b5e93411aac56b4b4/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) as well as [my working schedule](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/11/07/2/#status-report). Also, summary posts and videos have often been overdue.
* Fortunately, there has been an identifiable positive trend in my performance since the previous summary, which you can examine in more detail using the flow diagram below, modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway) (see the [previous diagram](https://zheln.com/flow-diagram/2020-11-11-1.png) for comparison).

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Nov 14, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-11-14-2.png)

* These improvements became possible in part because of the [layered appraisal process](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#primary-appraisal-stage) I introduced. It allows me to release records at earlier appraisal states.
* The full-featured [academic protocol for Zheln](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/2) and the [Zheln nonprofit business plan](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/4) will be published for [Zheln Primary Appraisals](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#primary-appraisal-stage) first. I cannot provide you with any date yet.
* Once I’ve streamlined primary appraisals, I will publish a protocol for [Full Appraisals](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/b184fa02d875fe7e1ec03add60234c94f10483a4/README.md#full-appraisal-stage) and start conducting thorough full critical appraisals (with focused replication) of a few [select reviews](#appraisals-in-progress), that will also become publicly available.

## Appraisals in Progress

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. Also, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Alternatively, you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).
