## What Exactly Is Zheln?

[Work Schedule](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f52d223a5d56e22dd7e898246bc7f515ab6d9c5d/zheln/Work_Schedule.md) | [Worked-Time Log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f52d223a5d56e22dd7e898246bc7f515ab6d9c5d/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) | [Appraisal Log](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f52d223a5d56e22dd7e898246bc7f515ab6d9c5d/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md)

* There are **789 recent systematic review** records on Zheln currently. They are added daily, most of them were published this fall, and each of them is counting as a _true positive_ by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) criteria for systematic reviews.
* These records came from my [Replicated Systematic Subset](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/README.md#pubmed-search) PubMed query retrieving **most of all systematic reviews being published** in peer-reviewed international health care journals.
* I’m also tagging the records with [AMA specialty tags](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/f23534a80ec8a842c928d8d3d3f5ae7ba699ccc1/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv) taken from the [AMA Physician Masterfile](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/masterfile/ama-physician-masterfile) specialty list, so you can [browse appraisals by AMA Specialty](/browse/).
* Otherwise, you can watch select Zheln records on the [YouTube channel for Zheln](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ). Since recently, I have started to publish critical appraisal videos daily.
* Read the full-featured academic protocol for Zheln here for free: [DOI 10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/y2nrb). I also submitted it for [PROSPERO](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/) registration but was told processing the submission might take up to three months due to very high demand.
* I welcome wide discussion and feedback of any sort very much, so please do [engage me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov) or elsewhere!

## Zheln Flow Diagram

![Zheln Flow Diagram for Dec 16, 2020](/flow-diagram/2020-12-16-1.png)

* This is the Zheln flow diagram. It shows the flow of systematic reviews on Zheln since the [last summary post](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/12/12/2/).
* The flow diagram is modified from the [PRISMA 2020 Statement preprint](https://doi.org/10.31222/osf.io/v7gm2) by [Matthew Page](https://twitter.com/mjpages) et al. and the [SRflowdiagram](https://github.com/nealhaddaway/SRflowdiagram) tool by [Neal Haddaway](https://twitter.com/nealhaddaway). I am deeply grateful to the original authors!

## List of Included Studies

As a rule, I select a review for full appraisal when the topic covered is likely to have a very large practice impact with regard either to both global health care workers and the public or to the minorities. [COVID-19 publications are not selected](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/commit/b86bda0b75e1103991c3d57d22c03a9d49807905). However, [crowdfunding an appraisal](#help-crowdfund-zheln) is possible.

Some of the appraisals are already available as videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNQzA3-71TyD-fVbXnxfKQ), so click the <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> button next to the appraisal heading to watch them!

## Making of Zheln

* Running Zheln all alone is very hard. As a result, [I miss some appraisal days](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), usually [don’t appraise 100% of daily records](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Appraisal_Log.md), and the [amount of time I spend on Zheln activities](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Worked_Time_Log.md) has varied.
* So, in this regard, I have chosen to follow the [Okazaki-fragments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okazaki_fragments) (or conveyor-belt) strategy: whenever I miss any record-processing, I usually do not go back but proceed further. These records may still be processed but only after all current work is done. I believe this is most appropriate for Zheln, due to its very living nature and in order to achieve steady current processing.
* Also, record-screening and specialty-tagging are very resource- and time-intensive and plain boring, while, at the same time, they could perfectly be automated using [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network).
* As soon as I crowd-raise [enough money to keep Zheln running ($600/mo)](#help-crowdfund-zheln), I will start integrating machine learning into record-screening and specialty-tagging. This will involve discussions with machine learning specialists in evidence synthesis, such as [Iain Marshall](https://twitter.com/ijmarshall), and will allow stable processing of 100% records.
* As to the amount of time I spend on Zheln, this is the best I can currently do due to the [health restrictions I wrote about earlier](https://zheln.com/summary/2020/10/31/2/#whats-going-on).

## Help Crowdfund Zheln

**Zheln Is Supported by Crowdfunding Only**

Running Zheln takes most of my work capacity. I’ve managed to stay off other jobs for now but will be forced to find another job unless crowdfunded by the end of this year.

In other words, you can’t be sure Zheln isn’t suspended in 2021 if you avoid funding it. But **if you donate, I pledge to keep running Zheln in recognition of your support.**

If you want Zheln to live on, please use one of these options:
