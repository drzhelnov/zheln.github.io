## Why Zheln?

Hi, this is Pavel Zhelnov, the founder and the workforce of Zheln. I have launched this project in the hopes of bringing evidence closer to practice—the clinical practice, in the first place, but also to other activities associated with intervention into a human life, such as education, business, or policy.

[Currently][Papes2020e13301] and [for more than 10 years now][Bastian2010e1000326], a wide gap has been recognized between the fast pace research is published and the limited capacity of evidence-based practitioners to promptly process it while also [separating the practice-changing wheat from the chaff][Contou202070]. And to my utmost disappointment, it is in contrast to a [variety of solutions available][Bougioukas2020e12318] that the [call for a dramatic change is out in 2020][Boutron2020135142].

Well, anyway, here I bring a change:

> Every systematic review daily added to PubMed will get a rigorous, independent, and open-access critical appraisal.

This is the **Zheln’s Mission.** [This is the way.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW7Twd85m2g) <i class="fab fa-mandalorian"></i>

## How Is Zheln Different?

The idea of _preappraised evidence summaries_ is [all but new][Haynes2006162164]. Anyone in the field of evidence-based medicine is well aware of the [ACP Journal Club](https://www.acpjournals.org/topic/category/journal-club), [Cochrane Clinical Answers](https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cca), or now legacy [DARE](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/crdweb/ShowRecord.asp?ID=32004000332&ID=32004000332) summaries, [just to mention a few][Chandran2020147154]. Not all of them cover secondary research only as Zheln does.

Anyway, I never found a resource that would have the following features at the same time (but if you did, I invite you to publicly discuss it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/drzhelnov)):

* Exhaustive research coverage
* Rigorous _conduct_ appraisals with replication attempts
* Independence proven by full process transparency
* Full Open Access
* Easy to use
  
Then, in the Summer 2019, I felt like the launch of another was warranted; however, one more year was needed for me to get free of institutional agendas and set a course for this undertaking.

## So What Does Zheln Offer?

### Exhaustive Research Coverage

**Nearly All Systematic Reviews Indexed by PubMed**

### Rigorous Conduct Appraisals with Replication Attempts

**Zheln Review Appraisal in 10 Steps:**

**Step 1. Download All Records from a Daily Update for the [Replicated Version of _PubMed Systematic Subset_](https://p1m.org/ssb)**

5,609 records uploaded to date (Sep 2 thru Sep 13, 2020).

**Step 2. Record Appraisal: Does Meet [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) True Positive Criteria for Systematic Reviews by Either Title or Abstract?**

Just a couple of records have got past this stage by now because [Zheln record screening methods are still in development](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/7). Namely, I’m developing a system to quickly process records in the Zheln format. Currently, development of the Zheln website was a priority, so the appraisals themselves got somewhat overdue. Follow the progress on the [public Zheln kanban](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/projects/1)!

**Step 3. Collect Full Text or Other Review Reports for the Record**

**Step 4. Full Appraisal: Does Generate Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?**

[One appraisal](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/issues/3) has been started started by now. I will complete it as soon as I have a good record triage system in place, because 5k+ records awaiting appraisal need to be processed ASAP.

**Step 5. Full Appraisal: Is Duplicate?**

**Step 6. Full Appraisal: Did Pass or Fail Replication?**

**Step 7. Full Appraisal: Has Critical Conduct Flaws?**

**Step 8. Like or Dislike by Zheln**

**Step 9. Summarize Practical Implications**

**Step 10. Publish the Appraisal & Call for Crowdfunding**
