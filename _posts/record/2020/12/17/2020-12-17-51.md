## Executive Summary

## Background

I first learned about this review [from Twitter](https://twitter.com/CochraneHTN/status/1339647732135256064). Then I posted about it on my health-educational resources in Russian ([Telegram](https://t.me/sanktprosvet/225), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/CI68VeWA10G/), [VK](https://vk.com/wall-50151591_329)). Also, I asked the subscribers if they wanted an extensive appraisal. As of Dec 19 @ 5am EST, there were 7/9 votes for and 2/9 votes against the extensive appraisal.

## Full Text & Other Reports Collected by Zheln

Successfully collected all three versions of this publication: the current 2020 paper, the outdated 2009 paper, and the 2003 protocol.

## Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?

All-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality (CV), and rates of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke are of interest. Most of them (save CV mortality) are featured in the review, so yes, it does in theory generate pragmatic practice-relevant evidence.

## Is Duplicate?

**[Google: systematic review target blood pressure](https://www.google.com/search?q=systematic+review+target+blood+pressure)**

Some of the top results:

* [Sakima 2019][Sakima2019483495] â€“ full text collected. Not referenced by Arguedas et al., although the research question of Sakima et al. is identical to that of Arguedas et al.
* [Reboussin 2018][Reboussin2018e116e135] â€” successfully collected the full text with [a correction][Hypertension2018e145]. One of the review questions is exactly the same as in the review by Arguedas et al. However, this review is not referenced by the authors of the index review.

These two are important reviews targeting practically the same population, interventions, and outcomes, and they were not referenced by the original authors. Therefore, I first made an assessment that this review was duplicate.

However, I felt like another look at the review report was warranted because it is just so hard to presume such ignorance, and found a section discussing previous research. There, several methodological differences between this review and the previous ones were stated, and I found that these differences were also a thing with respect to the two aforementioned reviews. Namely, both [Reboussin 2018][Reboussin2018e116e135] and [Sakima 2019][Sakima2019483495] interpret interventions as more or less intensive, whereas Arguedas et al. look at specific blood pressure (BP) targets. There possibly are more differences, but I believe this is already enough to disprove my previous reservations about the index review duplication.

The index review is an update of the previous 2009 review, so it is also worth looking at the reasons for the update, but thatâ€™s plain enough because 7 more eligible studies were identified in addition to the 4 earlier trials.

Thus, all in all, I donâ€™t see that the review is importantly duplicate.
