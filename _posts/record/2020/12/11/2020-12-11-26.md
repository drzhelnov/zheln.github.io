## Generates Pragmatic Evidence Directly Relevant to Evidence-Based Practice?

Preterm birth rate, low birth weight rate, and infant mortality are usually listed as adverse birth outcomes. These are clearly patient-important too. The review features some of these, so it does in theory generate practice-important evidence.

## Is Duplicate?

I ran a low-effort [Google search: green urban preterm birth meta analysis OR metaanalysis](https://google.com/search?q=green+urban+preterm+birth+meta+analysis+OR+metaanalysis). Some very similar reviews (and recent too) instantly showed ([Akaraci 2020][Akaraci20202949]; [Lee 2020][Lee202091]). I successfully collected all the full texts. The authors do reference [Akaraci 2020][Akaraci20202949] at multiple places throughout the report despite it being a very recent study (April 2020); this is commendable. However, they do not reference [Lee 2020][Lee202091], but this is an even more recent study (August 2020). Also, no registration info is available from [Lee 2020][Lee202091], nor does it show up in the [PROSPERO advanced search](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/#searchadvanced) results. Three records were found there for `birth AND (green*):TI`:

* Green spaces and birth outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [[CRD42020177721](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020177721)] – it’s the registration by Hu et al. themselves.
* Influence of Residential Greenness on Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Dose-response Meta-analysis [[CRD42020162387](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42020162387)] — I located and collected the report full text ([Zhan 2020][Zhan2020137420]); this study is also notably referenced by Hu et al. despite it being very recent (May 2020).
* The health benefits of the great outdoors: a systematic review and meta-analysis of greenspace exposure and health outcomes [[CRD42015025193](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42015025193)] — I located and collected the report full text ([Twohig-Bennett 2018][TwohigBennett2018628637]); this study is not referenced by Hu et al. However, reading the [Twohig-Bennett 2018][TwohigBennett2018628637] report showed that this review explicitly excluded birth outcomes, so was in fact irrelevant.

From the aforementioned Google search, I also identified closely related reviews by [Porpora et al. (2019)][Porpora201911] and [Bekkar et al. (2020)][Bekkar2020e208243] (with [a correction][JAMANetwOpen2020e208243]; all full texts collected by Zheln). These are also not referenced by Hu et al. Notably, **Bekkar 2020** is [another ongoing appraisal on Zheln](https://zheln.com/record/2020/11/20/429/), so have a look at it too. Anyway, in contrast to other reviews mentioned previously, these two reviews are actually not about greenery but about environmental hazards, such as air pollution. Therefore, they are not directly relevant to the topic in question.

At last, [Dzhambov 2014][Dzhambov2014621629] was cited in some of the reports. It was probably the first systematic review on this topic. I have collected its full text too.

The general design layout of these relevant reviews is taking satellite measurements of environmental greenness (usually in the form of [NDVI](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/MeasuringVegetation/measuring_vegetation_2.php)) around the mother’s home location, on the one hand, and either birth weight or some bad-pregnancy-outcome rate, on the other hand, and calculating associations between the two variables using meta-analysis. Also, various confounders are usually accounted for in the calculation model.

So what’s so new about the review by Hu et al.? It appears that the methods were somewhat different from before and some new studies were taken into account. The authors provided a clear explanation about that. Okay, so this is not duplicate then.

## Passed or Failed Replication?

No supplementary data, that reportedly contain full search strategies, is available to me because of the paywall, so I can’t replicate the searches.

Clearly, this is not a problem of the study, but this is a paywall problem. Still, I can’t go on with the appraisal without these data. I’ll be able to go on once I get these supplementaries.

> I have already started appraisal of this article and have not been able to replicate it. Replicability (reproducibility) is a must-have for a great systematic review, but sometimes it is compromised mostly by bad reporting. Therefore, assessing this review comprehensively will require me to make every effort to collect all available study records, including contacting the authors, and will take considerable time. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/master/{{ page.path }}) as I do the appraisal. Also, you can look for similar systematic review appraisals using [search](/search/) or by tapping on [AMA specialty tags](/browse/) at the bottom of this page or in the side menu.
