> I have looked at this record and found that it does not meet ‘true positive criteria’ for systematic reviews by [Shojania & Bero 2001](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/11820967_Taking_Advantage_of_the_Explosion_of_Systematic_Reviews_An_Efficient_MEDLINE_Search_Strategy) that I chose to use in [record screening on Zheln](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/README.md#record-screening).

> Namely, it means this record does not mention neither ‘systematic review’ nor ‘meta-analysis’ in its title, nor does it contain a literature search strategy in its abstract.
>
> Therefore, this record is ineligible for a Zheln appraisal.
