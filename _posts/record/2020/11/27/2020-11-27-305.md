> I have already looked at this record and made a decision not to advance further for the time being as I did not find this topic exceptionally appealing.
>
> Please accept my apologies. However, please also keep in mind this project is independent research and is supported by crowdfunding only. Anyway, I could not possibly appraise **hundreds** of reviews coming up daily on PubMed.
> 
> If you really need me to appraise this review ASAP, please consider buying a $1 to $600 Zheln subscription on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/zheln), [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/drzhelnov), or [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/zheln).
