Systematic reviews conducted are not reported clearly in this document. Only the summarized results are reported, so this is not replicable.

> I have already started appraisal of this article and have not been able to replicate it. Replicability (reproducibility) is a must-have for a great systematic review, but sometimes it is compromised mostly by bad reporting. Therefore, assessing this review comprehensively will require me to make every effort to collect all available study records, including contacting the authors, and will take considerable time. I will complete the appraisal as soon as I’m able to. Please return sometime later or follow the progress of this page here or on [GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/commits/gh-pages/{{ page.path }}) as I do the appraisal. Also, you can look for similar systematic review appraisals using [search](/search/) or by tapping on [AMA specialty tags](/browse/) at the bottom of this page or in the side menu.
