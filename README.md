Hi, this is Pavel Zhelnov. I founded [Zheln.com](https://zheln.com), a crowdfunding project, where I check [PubMed](https://pubmed.gov) for updates in the [Systematic Review Subset](https://p1m.org/ssb) and critically assess the most appealing reviews. I named the project after the _zhelna_, the [black woodpecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_woodpecker), who do the same thing I do: Hit to the core. This is independent research and my primary job.

Previously, I ran academic research as a medical school postgraduate while also working as a physician and a medical reviewer but quit to get rid of unfair agendas and fully devote myself to systematic reviews.

You can learn more about my research background from my academic profiles at [GitHub](https://github.com/drzhelnov), [OSF](https://osf.io/9c83x/), [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2767-5123), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-zhelnov-382073182), [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=b421BNkAAAAJ), & [ResearchGate](https://researchgate.net/profile/Pavel_Zhelnov). Also, feel free to get in touch either by [email](mailto:pavel@zheln.com) or on [Telegram](https://t.me/drzhelnov).

I currently reside with my dearest wife in the most beautiful city of Saint Petersburg, Russia. In my spare time, I go out or watch anime / listen to opera with friends & family. ðŸŒš

Also, Iâ€™m an avid fan of **Star Wars**!
