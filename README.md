# Zheln [![Woodpecker by Anton from The Noun Project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drzhelnov/zheln.github.io/gh-pages/favicons/favicon-32x32.png)](https://zheln.com)

Hi, this is Pavel Zhelnov [[CV]](https://drzhelnov.github.io). I founded [Zheln.com](https://zheln.com), an affilitation-free, crowdfunded, nonprofit [Open Evidence Synthesis](https://opensynthesis.github.io) project. I checked a major [health research database](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/Replicated_Systematic_Subset_Query.md) for daily updates, tagged new records with [medical specialties](https://github.com/p1m-ortho/qs-global-ortho-search-queries/blob/global-sr-query/zheln/zheln_ama_specialty_tags.csv), and reviewed them. I would select the research study that I thought would have the most impact on the broadest possible audience, critically appraise it, and publish an evidence summary. I named the project after the _zhelna_, the [black woodpecker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_woodpecker), because they do the same thing I did: _Hit to the core._

After 4 months in operation, I put the project on hold due to the low yield of my crowdfunding campaign. After another 15 months, I [discontinued](https://zheln.com/summary/2022/04/06/suppl/) the original project and [adapted](https://zheln.com/summary/2022/04/06/suppl/) it as a fee-for-service model, Zheln as Service.

Since July 2023, I have been working on [restarting](https://zheln.com/thread/2023/07/13/1/) public evidence updates. I self-fund this work, depending partially on my Zheln as Service income, but my clients have no role in this initiative. The restart also lays the groundwork for a global information accessibility initiative, [Pick One Medicine](https://p1m.org/).
