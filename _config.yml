title_description: "Daily, I check [PubMed](https://pubmed.gov) for updates in the systematic review subset ([see methods](https://p1m.org/ssb)) and critically assess the most appealing reviews. I also categorize the posts, so please check the archive for your specialty. This is independent research, and I do it as my primary job, so the community support is essential. Please support me on Patreon, where you can also learn more about myself."
