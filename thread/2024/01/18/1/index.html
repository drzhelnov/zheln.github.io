<h4 id="the-facts">The Facts:</h4>

<p>Tamiflu, an anti-flu medication, reduces the duration of illness by about half a day on average and prevents 2­–4% of cases of symptomatic flu, but it does not prevent positive lab tests if the person has no symptoms, and it also increases the rate of nausea, vomiting, and headache. This is the evidence from a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4" title="Jefferson T, Jones MA, Doshi P, Del Mar CB, Hama R, Thompson MJ, Spencer EA, Onakpoya I, Mahtani KR, Nunan D, Howick J, Heneghan CJ. Neuraminidase inhibitors for preventing and treating influenza in adults and children. Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2014 Apr 10;2014(4):CD008965. doi: 10.1002/14651858.CD008965.pub4. PMID: 24718923; PMCID: PMC6464969.">major 2014 study</a>, whose results are mirrored pretty accurately in two of Google’s top hits for <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tamiflu">Tamiflu</a>, consumer webpages by the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tamiflu-consumer-questions-and-answers">U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration</a> (FDA) and the <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu">European Medicines Agency</a> (EMA).</p>

<p>Tamiflu has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations. The agencies are not trying to make it look like it did, but they are not particularly vocal about this either. True: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence; but, when multiple well conducted trials failed to prove the effect, it might be worth highlighting these findings. Otherwise, it is just logical to assume that if the drug is <i class="fab fa-youtube"></i> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5LSP02MkNOU">active against viruses</a>, then it should reduce the risk of severe illness. At short notice, Zheln did not find much evidence people actually assume that, but at least one of the top Google results does seem to <a href="https://www.parents.com/health/cold-flu/flu/tamiflu-and-kids-everything-parents-need-to-know/">follow this logic</a>; “Early treatment with Tamiflu can lead to milder illness, which lessens the number of hospitalizations and deaths associated with the flu,” they write. However, other top Google hits are pretty circumspect in <a href="https://www.drugs.com/tips/tamiflu-patient-tips">giving account</a> of Tamiflu’s effects. One doctor author <a href="https://health.mountsinai.org/blog/is-it-worth-it-to-take-tamiflu/">suggested</a> that “expectations for Tamiflu are often very high and, frankly, overhyped.” A 2022 news story <a href="https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/quebec-to-offer-free-antiviral-flu-drug-in-pharmacies-1.6192420">revealed</a> that health authorities of one of the regions of Canada worked to offer Tamiflu for free, with a high official saying, “It’s quite effective to prevent complications, hospitalizations.” All in all, it looks like it is worth revisiting the disheartening evidence related to Tamiflu, particularly because a newer study was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0699" title="Hanula R, Bortolussi-Courval É, Mendel A, Ward BJ, Lee TC, McDonald EG. Evaluation of Oseltamivir Used to Prevent Hospitalization in Outpatients With Influenza: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. JAMA Intern Med. 2024 Jan 1;184(1):18-27. doi: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2023.0699. Erratum in: JAMA Intern Med. 2023 Nov 20;: PMID: 37306992; PMCID: PMC10262060.">published</a> in 2023, focusing specifically on the rate of hospital treatment on Tamiflu versus placebo.</p>

<p>Zheln is not the first to cover that recent study: <a href="https://www.jwatch.org/na56236/2023/07/06/oseltamivir-doesnt-prevent-hospitalizations-outpatients">New England Journal of Medicine Journal Watch</a>, <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/topics/respiratory/influenza/does-oseltamivir-prevent-all-cause-hospitalization-in-outpatients-with-influenza/">InfectiousDisease Advisor</a>, and <a href="https://medicalxpress.com/news/2023-06-oseltamivir-linked-flu-hospitalization.html">MedicalXpress</a> highlighted the findings of the study, and <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/infectiousdisease/uritheflu/104963">MedPage Today</a> also did a great job interviewing one of the study authors. If you read all of these publications, there is not much Zheln can add, honestly.</p>

<p>The most important takeaway would be that when 3,000 mostly White outpatients in their 40s, with flu but relatively healthy otherwise, were treated with Tamiflu across 15 randomized trials, about the same 25 people eventually required hospital treatment as in the similar 3,000 patient group that took placebo and/or standard therapy. Additionally, the rate of nausea or vomiting was at least 13% higher and at most 2.6 times as high on Tamiflu. The quality of the trials was high enough for the researchers to be moderately certain of these findings, making the evidence somewhat less likely to change with future trials being added to the big picture. Zheln’s fifty cents would be that the piece of information enclosed in this paragraph essentially is the evidence – just some numbers with a pinch of scientific scrutiny over it. An important feature of evidence, the reader is free to interpret it the way they see fit. It’s also good to keep in mind that this stuff is as scientific as iPhones, X-rays, or antibiotics, just less visible and tangible (think astronomy).</p>

<h4 id="the-evidence">The Evidence:</h4>

<!---
Zheln: summarize the below in bullet points:

Claude 2 AI:  Here are the key points summarized in bullet points:

- A major 2014 study found that Tamiflu reduces flu illness duration by about half a day on average and prevents some flu cases from happening. This aligns with info from the FDA and European Medicines Agency.

- Tamiflu has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations from the flu.

- A 2023 study of over 6,100 people with the flu found no difference in hospitalizations between those given Tamiflu vs those given placebo or standard therapy.

- The study participants were relatively healthy - in their 40s on average, mostly White or Asian, with few chronic illnesses. 

- If Tamiflu worked as well as advertised, the number of hospitalizations should have dropped at least twofold, from 25 to 12 or less. But the actual number was statistically no different.

- The evidence on Tamiflu is just some numbers with scientific scrutiny. Science is like a board game - you learn some lore and you can interpret data.

- People with a disease are important decision makers, not just health professionals. The health care system should serve their best interests.

PMID: 24718923; PMCID: PMC6464969.">2014 Cochrane systematic review</a> found that Tamiflu (oseltamivir) reduces flu illness duration by 8–25 hours on average and prevents 2 cases in every 52­–110 cases of symptomatic influenza from happening, but not cases without symptoms. The risk of headache, nausea, and vomiting was higher on treatment. This aligns with info from some of Google’s top hits on <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=tamiflu">Tamiflu</a>, such as those from the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/postmarket-drug-safety-information-patients-and-providers/tamiflu-consumer-questions-and-answers">FDA</a> and <a href="https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/tamiflu">European Medicines Agency</a>.</li>
  <li>In the same study, oseltamivir has not been shown to reduce deaths or hospitalizations from flu, pooling the data from 7 randomized trials and 4,400 patients, a fact not prominent in the agencies’ statements. However, a brief overview of Google’s top hits revealed that the assumption that Tamiflu prevents serious flu, arising from the general interpretation of its antiviral properties, is not uncommon among the public.</li>
