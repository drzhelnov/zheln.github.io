Hi, this is [Pavel Zhelnov][cv]. I monitor the U.S. [National Library of Medicine][pubmed]â€™s weekly research updates. With the help of other researchers, journalists, and multiple AI tools, I select high-quality and impactful studies and feature them on this website. I record the entire process using [Stone][stone] transparency software. [Read whitepaper.][whitepaper]

[Subscribe][sponsors] to receive email updates and support the content creation.

This is an affiliation-free, nonprofit project. I self-fund this work, depending partially on my [Zheln as Service][zaas] income, but my clients have no role in this initiative.
